<p>We at <em>The Daily Nonsense</em> have not been particularly kind to the time-traveling bandits behind the pseudo-publication known as “The Daily Nexus”. Our writers have referred to them as a <a href="../nonsense.html" title="Announcement of the launch of The Daily Nonsense on Baruffio.com">“cabal of hacks”</a> who publish <a href="https://twitter.com/dunndunndunn/status/327667602971320320" title="Tweet by @dunndunndunn on 25 April 2013">“racist garbage”</a>. So it was not particularly surprising that they eventually made an official response. What was surprising was when and how this response was made, and the heartwarming ending to the ensuing affair.</p>
<p><em>The Daily Nonsense</em> was launched yesterday to much acclaim. The most evident testimony of its immediate impact was the reaction from a group of campus Republicans, who went back in time <em>over 40 years</em> to start a competing publication. These scoundrels founded “The Daily Nexus” in order to undermine our credibility and dilute our brand. For decades they prepared for the day when they would use their clout to strike the <em>Nonsense</em> down on the very day it launched.</p>
<p>That day came.</p>

<p>By launching on a weekend, we attempted to catch the <em>Nexus</em> off-guard and establish ourselves as the only legitimate news source:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>
NB: Campus Republicans are trying to dilute our brand by squatting on the @<a
href="https://twitter.com/dailynexus">dailynexus</a> account. They are NOT the Daily Nonsense!

<p>Late that night, they struck. We at the <em>Nonsense</em> knew what was coming as soon as the <em>Nexus</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/dailynexus/status/328373627819028480" title="Tweet from @dailynexus on 27 April 2013">tweeted a link to an article</a> titled “Seth Rogen enjoys being in control”. We were threatening the <em>Nexus’</em> <strong>control</strong> over the UCSB news cycle, and <a href="https://twitter.com/dailynexus/status/328374159220539392" title="Deleted tweet by @dailynexus from 27 April 2013">they were not pleased</a>:</p>

<p>After 40 years of hegemony the <em>Nexus</em> was suddenly experiencing real competition. Having become so accustomed to being on top, they panicked and lashed out. It became clear that <a href="https://twitter.com/dailynexus/status/328376801854369792" title="Deleted tweet by @dailynexus from 27 April 2013">they were confused</a>, no longer sure how to respond:</p>

</figure>
<p>Finally comprehending the magnitude of our superiority, they <a href="https://twitter.com/dailynexus/status/328376961317613568" title="Deleted tweet by @dailynexus from 27 April 2013">acknowledged defeat</a>:</p>

</figure>
<p>After some hasty negotiations, it was decided that the <em>Nexus</em> would become a subsidiary of the <em>Nonsense</em>. As part of the agreement, they began retweeting our content:</p>

</figure>
<p>But the merger was not entirely painless. Certain comments by one of our writers <a href="https://twitter.com/dailynexus/status/328382045577433089" title="Deleted tweet by @dailynexus on 27 April 2013">rankled the <em>Nexus</em> staff</a>:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/dn_really.jpg" title="Tweets: @dunndunndunn says &quot;The @dailynexus is publishing more racist garbage&quot; and @dailynexus replies &quot;really now&quot;" alt="Screenshot by @dunndunndunn" /><figcaption>Screenshot by <a href="https://twitter.com/dunndunndunn" title="Twitter">@dunndunndunn</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>That is rather inflammatory! In addition, the article in question was found, <a href="pc.html" title="&quot;What Do Words Mean?&quot;">on closer examination</a>, to be a work of biting <em>anti-racist</em> satire. <strong>We therefore apologized to Mark Strong and the <em>Nexus</em> for the remarks of our feline mascot, and do so publicly again.</strong></p>
<p>That misunderstanding aside, all is well between us:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>

</blockquote>

<p>The future looks bright for the joint <em>Nonsense/Nexus</em>. Going forward we will be officially merging into a single publication known as the <strong>Noxious</strong>. Thank you again for your support.</p>

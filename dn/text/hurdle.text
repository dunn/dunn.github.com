During Emile Nelson's tenure at the *Nexus*, great gains have been
made for Men's Rights.  He established himself as a leader of the
[incel movement](http://www.involuntarycelibacy.com/ "The Incel
Project") by eloquently explaining how sex is, for the male, often
[*an act of self-defense*](batman.html "Batman is Best at Everything,
Including Fighting the Matriarchy").  The truth of this is clearly
shown by the following lament from a man who has found himself
involuntarily celibate:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Being incel really fucks you up. Not only do you not get to have sex, but you also develop bizarre fetishes and usually become racist.</p>&mdash; Puahate.txt (@puahate_txt) <a href="https://twitter.com/puahate_txt/statuses/336300385478275072">May 20, 2013</a></blockquote>

But Mister Nelson also did a great service to mankind by developing a
cogent argument to the effect that
[women who are not virgins have profound mental handicaps](hump.html
"How To Have Sex While Hating Yourself And Others").  By setting forth
these truths, he dealt a serious blow to the misandrist goal of
subjugating men under the promiscuous heel of a woman.

Lord Nelson appears to have taken a well-deserved break over the
summer, though, and in his absence trouble is brewing.  Known
misandrist "Haley K." has used her bully pulpit at the *Nexus* to [shame
men into once more obeying female whims](http://dailynexus.com/2013-06-26/the-hurdles-to-jump-before-you-hump/
"The Hurdles to Jump Before You Hump").  But we stand in solidarity
with Emile Nelson and say, "Never Again!"

Haley betrays her agenda early on:

> Although the basic standards for guys are much less demanding, many
> still struggle with taking the deceptively simple steps necessary to
> get laid.

"Deceptively simple"?  Has Haley K. never heard the heart-wrenching
testimony of
[those men who have been reduced to asking the government to find them a partner](https://governmentsgetgirlfriends.wordpress.com/2013/02/01/my-parents-criminals-who-deserve-to-be-put-in-jail-or-killed/
"My parents --- criminals who deserve to be put in jail or killed")?
The suffering of these poor souls will not be alleviated by buying
into matriarchal beauty standards.  "Proper pants" and "great hair"
are merely further tools of oppression.  And don't get me started on
chivalry:

> Okay, so it's old-fashioned, but everyone loves a knight in shining
> armor.  Hold the door open, offer up your jacket on those cold
> nights, give a compliment here and there and remember that the
> occasional bouquet of flowers never hurt anybody.  Go the extra mile
> so that they will too.

Men are being asked to follow arcane rules steeped in misandry in
exchange for the sex that they are owed!  Haley is treating women as
if they were slot machines that release sex when the right combination
of compliments and flowers are supplied.  But as any
[MRA](http://www.reddit.com/r/mensrights "/r/mensrights") will tell
you, that is not the right way of looking at things.  Rather, women
should be seen as the candy in those little bowls at banks that you
can take even if you aren't depositing any money.  You deserve it,
just for showing up!

Let us pray that Emile Nelson returns to us and preaches these truths
again.

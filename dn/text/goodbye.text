It's a sad day.  Mr Jeffrey Robin, whose intriguing piece of analytic
philosophy was the subject of
[the very first essay published by the *Nonsense*](robin.html
"Critical discussion of a metaphysical thesis recently proposed by
Mr. Robin"), is stepping down from his position as Reactionary Bigot
at the *Daily Nexus*.

He begins with some
[misty-eyed remembrances](http://dailynexus.com/2013-05-28/right-side-columnist-bids-ucsb-farewell/
"Right-Side Columnist Bids UCSB Farewell"):

> I'll be perfectly honest---UCSB wasn't my first choice, by far.  I
> came out of high school the preppy, sarcastic valedictorian of a
> sleepy suburb no one's heard of.  Despite receiving the Regents
> Scholarship here, I was sure that I was off to Pomona College in
> Claremont.

Being valedictorian of an entire suburb is a remarkable
accomplishment, and while I share Mr Robin's astonishment that he was
not accepted at a more prestigious institution, I am incredibly
grateful that we at UCSB have been blessed with his presence.  It
seems that he, too, has gained from his association with public-school
leeches:

> Getting waitlisted at every private school I wanted to go to gave me
> the greatest lesson in humility I think I have ever experienced. But
> as I sit here writing an article I've been thinking about for
> months, I don't think I could be more glad for it.

> My time at UCSB has profoundly changed me in ways I could never have
> anticipated. It flipped me upside down.

Such is the power of education.  When you leave your sleepy suburb and
enter a state university, not only are you exposed to new ideas in
your classes, but you come into contact with *people* that you haven't
met before, people whose backgrounds and worldviews differ sharply
from your own.  Being able to learn from the experiences of others,
especially from those less privileged than yourself, is a huge
opportunity to become a better and more tolerant person.

Oh.

Truly a wrenching change!  I can hardly imagine a situation better
described as being "flipped upside down", except perhaps the
transformation involved in moving from the Socialist Equality Party to
the International Socialist Organization (a process that invariably
destroys friendships).

A daring admission to make in these hateful, secular times.  But I
doubt he will come under too much fire, as long as he doesn't use his
new-found faith to justify
[vicious attacks on the rights of others](http://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/contest-government-almighty-judge-soul/

Too late.

Mr Jeffrey Robin ends his tenure at the *Nexus* fittingly, with a
quote that he doesn't seem to really understand:

> *"I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every
> form of tyranny over the mind of man"* --- Thomas Jefferson

The tyranny that Jefferson speaks of here is
[that of organized Christianity](http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=JefLett.sgm&images=images/modeng&data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&tag=public&part=133&division=div1
"Letter to To Dr. Benjamin Rush, Sep. 23, 1800"), were it allowed to
be established as a state religion.  But if Jeffrey realized
this---that the hero he quotes is arguing *against* the sort of thing
that would allow Christian institutions to
[deny women basic reproductive rights](http://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/contest-government-almighty-judge-soul/
"\"A Contest Over Whether Your Government or the Almighty is the Judge
of Your Soul\"")---then he would not be our beloved Mr Robin.

We will miss him *very* much.

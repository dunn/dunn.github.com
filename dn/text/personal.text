Mark Strong is just about the luckiest person in the world.  Not only
is he white, male and (presumably) straight and cis, he also has a
column in the finest student newspaper at UCSB that isn't *The Bottom
Line* or *The Daily Nonsense*.  And if that weren't enough, [ideas for
his columns simply fall into his lap wherever he goes!](http://dailynexus.com/2013-05-23/when-becoming-the-issue-becomes-the-issue/

Muffins, coffee, and spectacles?  Hipsters, surely!

Lest you thought that Mark Strong's success in life is only the result
of the incredible privilege he was born with, here he demonstrates
that hard work has also played a part.  Ben Moss needs at least
[450 words of clickbait](sexy.html "Stop Making Sense \(feat. Ben
Moss\)") to inspire his articles, but Mark Strong can get by with just
two
[poorly-chosen](http://infotrope.net/2009/08/05/action-and-reaction-on-avoiding-offense/
"Action and reaction: on avoiding \"offense\"") words from a hipster.
"Personally offended?  Offended ... personally?"  He plays around with
them, rolling them over his tongue, and through some alchemical
process, a column emerges.  Compare his thought process to Tom
Friedman's, and it becomes clear that
[they are related by something more than blood](http://buffalobeast.com/73/feature4.htm

Brain"):

(What the *fuck* does that even mean?)

After wondering for some time what it could possibly mean to be
personally offended (he having been lucky enough to avoid that
feeling), Mark Strong asks the question that has largely defined his
life:

> When did we start taking things so goddamn personally?

Mark Strong yearns for the days when lucky men like him could
*rationally* debate the issues of the day without having to suffer the
emotional outbursts of those personally affected.  These hysterical
children should be ignored, for "in personalizing the issue, [they]
eradicate [their] ability to think of it objectively."

Happily for Mark Strong, he doesn't really care very much about
Palestine, abortion, and other vitally important issues (in this way,
he's something of a hipster himself).  They're interesting things to
play Devil's advocate with, but ultimately (luckily!) they don't
affect Mark Strong's life, so why would anyone get worked up about
them?  Just *let it go*.

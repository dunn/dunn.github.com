We at *The Daily Nonsense* have not been particularly kind to the
time-traveling bandits behind the pseudo-publication known as "The
Daily Nexus".  Our writers have referred to them as a
["cabal of hacks"](../nonsense.html "Announcement of the launch of The
Daily Nonsense on Baruffio.com") who publish
["racist garbage"](https://twitter.com/dunndunndunn/status/327667602971320320
"Tweet by @dunndunndunn on 25 April 2013").  So it was not particularly
surprising that they eventually made an official response.  What was
surprising was when and how this response was made, and the
heartwarming ending to the ensuing affair.

*The Daily Nonsense* was launched yesterday to much acclaim.  The most
evident testimony of its immediate impact was the reaction from a
group of campus Republicans, who went back in time *over 40 years* to
start a competing publication.  These scoundrels founded "The Daily
Nexus" in order to undermine our credibility and dilute our brand.
For decades they prepared for the day when they would use their clout
to strike the *Nonsense* down on the very day it launched.

That day came.

By launching on a weekend, we attempted to catch the *Nexus* off-guard
and establish ourselves as the only legitimate news source:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>NB: Campus Republicans are trying
to dilute our brand by squatting on the @<a
href="https://twitter.com/dailynexus">dailynexus</a> account.  They are NOT the Daily Nonsense!</p>&mdash; The Daily Nonsense (@thedailynexus) <a href="https://twitter.com/thedailynexus/status/328256959952347138">April 27, 2013</a></blockquote>

Late that night, they struck.  We at the *Nonsense* knew what was
coming as soon as the *Nexus*
[tweeted a link to an article](https://twitter.com/dailynexus/status/328373627819028480
"Tweet from @dailynexus on 27 April 2013") titled "Seth Rogen enjoys
being in control".  We were threatening the *Nexus'* **control** over
the UCSB news cycle, and
[they were not pleased](https://twitter.com/dailynexus/status/328374159220539392
"Deleted tweet by @dailynexus from 27 April 2013"):

\"what the fuck\"")

After 40 years of hegemony the *Nexus* was suddenly experiencing real
competition.  Having become so accustomed to being on top, they
panicked and lashed out.  It became clear that
[they were confused](https://twitter.com/dailynexus/status/328376801854369792
"Deleted tweet by @dailynexus from 27 April 2013"), no
longer sure how to respond:

"Twitter")](img/dn_what.png "Tweets: @dunndunndunn asks \"gosh what's
up with the daily nexus\" and @dailynexus replies \"good question\"")

Finally comprehending the magnitude of our superiority, they
[acknowledged defeat](https://twitter.com/dailynexus/status/328376961317613568
"Deleted tweet by @dailynexus from 27 April 2013"):

![Screenshot by [\@dunndunndunn](https://twitter.com/dunndunndunn
"Twitter")](img/dn_good.png "@dailynexus to @thedailynexus: \"good
one\"")

After some hasty negotiations, it was decided that the *Nexus* would
become a subsidiary of the *Nonsense*.  As part of the agreement, they
began retweeting our content:

![Screenshot by [\@dunndunndunn](https://twitter.com/dunndunndunn
"Twitter")](img/dn_tcot.jpg "@dailynexus retweets @thedailynexus")

![Screenshot by [\@dunndunndunn](https://twitter.com/dunndunndunn
"Twitter")](img/dn_cat.jpg "@dailynexus retweets @dunndunndunn")

But the merger was not entirely painless.  Certain comments by one of
our writers
[rankled the *Nexus* staff](https://twitter.com/dailynexus/status/328382045577433089
"Deleted tweet by @dailynexus on 27 April 2013"):

![Screenshot by [\@dunndunndunn](https://twitter.com/dunndunndunn
"Twitter")](img/dn_really.jpg "Tweets: @dunndunndunn says \"The
@dailynexus is publishing more racist garbage\" and @dailynexus
replies \"really now\"")

That is rather inflammatory!  In addition, the article in question was
found, [on closer examination](pc.html "\"What Do Words Mean?\""), to
be a work of biting *anti-racist* satire.  **We therefore apologized
to Mark Strong and the *Nexus* for the remarks of our feline mascot,
and do so publicly again.**

That misunderstanding aside, all is well between us:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/dunndunndunn">dunndunndunn</a> &lt;3</p>&mdash; Daily Nexus (@dailynexus) <a href="https://twitter.com/dailynexus/status/328385484080443392">April 28, 2013</a></blockquote>

The future looks bright for the joint *Nonsense/Nexus*.  Going forward
we will be officially merging into a single publication known as the
**Noxious**.  Thank you again for your support.

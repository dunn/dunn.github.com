Mark Strong, Managing Editor of the *Daily Nexus* and author of a
column with the whimsical title "Politically Incorrect", is troubled
and
[has turned to his readers with a pressing question](http://dailynexus.com/2013-04-25/so-wrong-its-right/
"So Wrong, It's Right"):

> What is "politically incorrect"?

"Goodness!" you might be saying.  "How could dear Mark write a column
called 'Politically Incorrect' without knowing what that means?
Surely the *Nexus*, of all student newspapers, is rigorously dedicated
to accuracy and would never print idiotic bullshit that flies in the
face of basic decency under the guise of bravely opposing conventional
wisdom?"

Strong reassures us somewhat in the next paragraph by exhibiting his
subtle analytical skills:

> That's a question I've been asking myself for a while.  With 18
> articles claiming the title, you'd think I'd have figured it out by
> now.  But the question is actually twofold.  "Politically
> Incorrect," the column, is not the same thing as politically
> incorrect, the concept, any more than a house is the same as its
> foundation.

This really is a crucial distinction.  Mark Strong's eighteen episodes
of concern trolling are in fact *not* identical with a term that is
widely used to make various forms of bigotry socially acceptable.

Nor is his column identical with the television show once hosted by
fellow freethinker
[Bill Mahar](http://www.juancole.com/2012/09/muslims-are-no-different-or-why-bill-mahers-blood-libel-is-bigotry.html
"Muslims are no Different, or why Bill Maher's blood libel is
Bigotry"), the title of which Strong honors by using as the title of
his own column.  ("Honors" here is the politically correct term for
"steals".)

It soon becomes clear that our faith in Mr. Strong was not misguided,
as he demonstrates a keen understanding of how "politically incorrect"
is used to perpetuate racism, sexism, and other systems of
institutional discrimination in a society where outright hate speech
is no longer acceptable:

> For the sake of this column, [political incorrectness is] about

Mark Strong here excellently brings out how racism can be given a pass
when in the correct context.  It is difficult indeed to defend the
writers at
[*Taki's Magazine*](http://takimag.com/article/im_not_a_racist_sexist_or_a_homophobe_you_nigger_slut_faggot/print
"Big Ol' Trigger Warning for Racism/Sexism/Homophobia"), but if you're
a **college professor** of Philosophy (a discipline that *definitely*
doesn't have issues with diversity) you can claim that you're speaking
in an "academic context" and that you are really just being coolly
analytical and why are these students walking out of your class?

Another example that Strong might have mentioned is the "hipster
racism" of Lisa Lampanelli, though her delivery was so artless that
even
[accidental racist Lena Dunham](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2012/04/lena-dunham-girls-race.html
"White \"Girls\"") distanced herself from the "joke":

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Me with my nigga @<a href="https://twitter.com/lenadunham">lenadunham</a> of @<a href="https://twitter.com/hbogirls">hbogirls</a> - I love this beyotch!! <a href="http://t.co/VOaV30eB" title="http://say.ly/oKP5chO">say.ly/oKP5chO</a></p>&mdash; Lisa Lampanelli (@LisaLampanelli) <a href="https://twitter.com/LisaLampanelli/status/303308274038616064">February 18, 2013</a></blockquote>

Our *Nexus* writer concludes, tongue firmly in cheek:

> So what is politically incorrect?  We could come up with

And with that nod to
[Daniel Tosh](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/07/11/why-daniel-tosh-s-rape-joke-at-the-laugh-factory-wasn-t-funny.html
"Why Daniel Tosh's 'Rape Joke' at the Laugh Factory Wasn't Funny"),
Mark Strong makes it quite clear what the pure truth is:

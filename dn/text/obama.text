Millennials love apps.  We make Tweets, we Tumbl, and Snap Chat with
each other all day long.  We also love President Obama.  Like,
[a lot](http://wonkette.com/498120/why-spend-17-95-on-erotic-obama-fan-fic-when-you-can-get-your-cow-for-free
"Why Spend $17.95 On 'Erotic' Obama Fan-Fic, When You Can Get Your Cow
At Wonket For Free?").  So we were very excited when we learned that
Obama was making an [app](https://www.healthcare.gov/).  An app made
by Obama would be the combination of the two things we love --- Obama
and apps.

But Obama did not make a good app.  His app is not the next Snap Chat.
It is not snappy.  It is bad.  Obama's bad app has left us Millennials
feeling betrayed and very sad.
[And angry](http://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/breaking-the-second-term-curse/

These words are coming from a Millennial, so they should concern
President Obama.  Especially because even though this Millennial is
writing under the name "Mckinley Krongaus" she is probably
actually [Lena Dunham](http://youtu.be/o6G3nwhPuR4):

One reason why Millennials are not happy about Obama's app is that a
cool feature was removed that we really wanted.
[We wanted to be able to be fucked over by insurance companies](http://wonkette.com/532898/obamas-you-can-keep-your-plan-failed-to-anticipate-how-much-americans-love-cheap-crappy-plans-that-cover-nothing
"Obamaâ€™s 'You Can Keep Your Plan' Failed To Anticipate How Much
Americans Love Cheap Crappy Plans That Cover Nothing"), and Obama's
app doesn't let us do that (no wait it was just
[updated](http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2013/11/obamacare-keep-your-insurance-plan),
we're all good).

But that's not the only reason we Millennials are mad.  We're also mad
because the Obama app is not a good app:

Lena Dunham is a Millennial, so she
[learned to code](https://medium.com/funny-stuff/d7e5d14065f1 "Dear
Miss Disruption") and knows some things:

- Move fast and break things

- Always be shipping

- Disrupt the industry

- Innovation

- Pivot

- "Entrepreneur"

- Horse_ebooks

Obama's app did not break things.  Obama's app is broken.  It's not
the same thing, and Obama's app is the bad one.  Also it did not move
fast.  Obama's app is slow.  The Health Sherpa is a good app because
it was made by Millennial.  It also has vision.
[It does one thing](http://e-pluribusunum.com/2013/11/11/why-healthsherpa-com-is-not-a-replacement-for-healthcare-gov/)
and does it well.  Obama's app tries to do too many things, like sell
people health insurance.  That's bad.  The Health Sherpa worked for 85
percent of its users.  Obama's app only worked for 100,000.

100,000 is less than 85 percent.  That's bad for Obama and his app.

Obama's app
[could not have been worse](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/10/why-the-healthcaregov-train-wreck-happened-in-slow-motion.html
"Healthcare.gov: It Could Be Worse").
It's as bad as the hurricane that
[killed a lot of people](http://www.esquire.com/blogs/politics/Things_That_Are_Not_Like_Each_Other
"Nobody Drowned From Obamacare").  Obama's app might be killing people
too maybe:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>obamacare is a fuckin trainwreck. kids with cancer don&#39;t even want insurance now. &quot;the website is bad,&quot; they said, dying. &quot;its too slow&quot;</p>&mdash; beefy tee (@BronzeHammer) <a href="https://twitter.com/BronzeHammer/statuses/391548402997407744">October 19, 2013</a></blockquote>

Thanks, Obama.

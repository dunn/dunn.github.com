*The Bottom Line*, the flagship publication of
[our media empire](drama.html "An Unlikely Friendship"), has a fine
record of [standing athwart history](who.html "There's No Woman Good
Enough To Play Dr. Who But There Are Strong Female Characters So Shut
It").  This week that tradition was honored by Madison Donahue-Wolfe,
who steals the Complain-About-Technology crown from
[Ben Moss](sexy.html "Stop Making Sense (feat. Ben Moss)") with
[this deep insight](http://thebottomline.as.ucsb.edu/2013/10/smartphones-how-being-constantly-connected-can-have-deathly-consequences
"Smartphones: How Being Constantly Connected Can Have Deathly
Consequences"):

You must, you must, **You Must,** because our sudden immersion in
"tech", something that has
[only just now occurred](http://punch.photoshelter.com/image/I00006GHuH4c0Ojo),
leaves us alienated and miserable, as a recent poll discovered:

We are now so "connected" and "excited" that we have ceased to sit and
stare at fellow passengers while riding trains, keeping an eye out for
guns and wondering when somebody will get around to inventing the
printing press so we can fucking read a book or something because this
commute feels like forever.

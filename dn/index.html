<h2>We Hardly Knew You</h2>
</header>
<p>It’s a sad day. Mr Jeffrey Robin, whose intriguing piece of analytic philosophy was the subject of <a href="robin.html" title="Critical discussion of a metaphysical thesis recently proposed by Mr. Robin">the very first essay published by the <em>Nonsense</em></a>, is stepping down from his position as Reactionary Bigot at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>
<p>He begins with some <a href="http://dailynexus.com/2013-05-28/right-side-columnist-bids-ucsb-farewell/" title="Right-Side Columnist Bids UCSB Farewell">misty-eyed remembrances</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ll be perfectly honest—UCSB wasn’t my first choice, by far. I came out of high school the preppy, sarcastic valedictorian of a sleepy suburb no one’s heard of. Despite receiving the Regents Scholarship here, I was sure that I was off to Pomona College in Claremont.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being valedictorian of an entire suburb is a remarkable accomplishment, and while I share Mr Robin’s astonishment that he was not accepted at a more prestigious institution, I am incredibly grateful that we at UCSB have been blessed with his presence. It seems that he, too, has gained from his association with public-school leeches:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Getting waitlisted at every private school I wanted to go to gave me the greatest lesson in humility I think I have ever experienced. But as I sit here writing an article I’ve been thinking about for months, I don’t think I could be more glad for it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My time at UCSB has profoundly changed me in ways I could never have anticipated. It flipped me upside down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such is the power of education. When you leave your sleepy suburb and enter a state university, not only are you exposed to new ideas in your classes, but you come into contact with <em>people</em> that you haven’t met before, people whose backgrounds and worldviews differ sharply from your own. Being able to learn from the experiences of others, especially from those less privileged than yourself, is a huge opportunity to become a better and more tolerant person.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I could not even imagine myself listening to country music. Now, country line and swing dancing is the single most time-consuming hobby I have. Once the prudish, smart-guy type who confused everyone with his diction, I’ve caught myself using the word “brah” perhaps a little more than I’d like.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh, and this too, I guess.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But perhaps my personal beliefs have undergone the greatest and most counterintuitive changes. I came here convinced of Ayn Randian philosophy and pure libertarian ideology, totally having bought in to the populism of Ron Paul (Tea Party before it was cool). Now, perhaps to your chagrin, I am the strictest of elitist constitutional conservatives, an advocate of the Empire of Liberty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Truly a wrenching change! I can hardly imagine a situation better described as being “flipped upside down”, except perhaps the transformation involved in moving from the Socialist Equality Party to the International Socialist Organization (a process that invariably destroys friendships).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most importantly, in a time when many in our country are increasingly antagonistic to the idea of God, I moved from a tepid agnosticist and occasional deist to a strong believer in Christ.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A daring admission to make in these hateful, secular times. But I doubt he will come under too much fire, as long as he doesn’t use his new-found faith to justify <a href="http://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/contest-government-almighty-judge-soul/" title="&quot;A Contest Over Whether Your Government or the Almighty is the Judge of Your Soul&quot;">vicious attacks on the rights of others</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I close, I exhort you all to not intertwine or falsely associate our faith with politics, as easy as it might be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Too late.</p>
<p>Mr Jeffrey Robin ends his tenure at the <em>Nexus</em> fittingly, with a quote that he doesn’t seem to really understand:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man”</em> — Thomas Jefferson</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tyranny that Jefferson speaks of here is <a href="http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=JefLett.sgm&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=133&amp;division=div1" title="Letter to To Dr. Benjamin Rush, Sep. 23, 1800">that of organized Christianity</a>, were it allowed to be established as a state religion. But if Jeffrey realized this—that the hero he quotes is arguing <em>against</em> the sort of thing that would allow Christian institutions to <a href="http://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/contest-government-almighty-judge-soul/" title="&quot;A Contest Over Whether Your Government or the Almighty is the Judge of Your Soul&quot;">deny women basic reproductive rights</a>—then he would not be our beloved Mr Robin.</p>
<p>We will miss him <em>very</em> much.</p>

<h2>Mark Strong Didn’t Give a Shit Before It Was Cool To Not Give a Shit</h2>
</header>
<p>Mark Strong is just about the luckiest person in the world. Not only is he white, male and (presumably) straight and cis, he also has a column in the finest student newspaper at UCSB that isn’t <em>The Bottom Line</em> or <em>The Daily Nonsense</em>. And if that weren’t enough, <a href="http://dailynexus.com/2013-05-23/when-becoming-the-issue-becomes-the-issue/" title="When Becoming the Issue Becomes the Issue">ideas for his columns simply fall into his lap wherever he goes!</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was digging into a new novel on the patio outside Nicoletti’s a few weeks back when a single word in a nearby conversation caught my attention: divestment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The pair—a guy and girl, both college-aged and bespectacled, sipping coffee and picking at muffins—was sitting directly behind me. Not one to eavesdrop, I tried to find my place on the page in front of me, but before I could, I heard the word again. Divestment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Muffins, coffee, and spectacles? Hipsters, surely!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I can’t believe they took it off the table again,” the girl was saying.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I know,” the guy said. “I’m personally offended. It just goes to show how the ignorance in the …”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Words kept coming out of his mouth after that, but I found myself suddenly engrossed and mulling over that two-word phrase. Personally offended? Offended … personally? What the fuck does that even mean?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lest you thought that Mark Strong’s success in life is only the result of the incredible privilege he was born with, here he demonstrates that hard work has also played a part. Ben Moss needs at least <a href="sexy.html" title="Stop Making Sense (feat. Ben Moss)">450 words of clickbait</a> to inspire his articles, but Mark Strong can get by with just two <a href="http://infotrope.net/2009/08/05/action-and-reaction-on-avoiding-offense/" title="Action and reaction: on avoiding &quot;offense&quot;">poorly-chosen</a> words from a hipster. “Personally offended? Offended … personally?” He plays around with them, rolling them over his tongue, and through some alchemical process, a column emerges. Compare his thought process to Tom Friedman’s, and it becomes clear that <a href="http://buffalobeast.com/73/feature4.htm" title="The Word is Hack: The Impossible Physics of Thomas Friedman&#39;s Brain">they are related by something more than blood</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I left the Infosys campus that evening along the road back to Bangalore, I kept chewing on that phrase: “The playing field is being leveled.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What Nandan is saying, I thought, is that the playing field is being flattened … Flattened? Flattened? My God, he’s telling me the world is flat!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(What the <em>fuck</em> does that even mean?)</p>
<p>After wondering for some time what it could possibly mean to be personally offended (he having been lucky enough to avoid that feeling), Mark Strong asks the question that has largely defined his life:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When did we start taking things so goddamn personally?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mark Strong yearns for the days when lucky men like him could <em>rationally</em> debate the issues of the day without having to suffer the emotional outbursts of those personally affected. These hysterical children should be ignored, for “in personalizing the issue, [they] eradicate [their] ability to think of it objectively.”</p>
<p>Happily for Mark Strong, he doesn’t really care very much about Palestine, abortion, and other vitally important issues (in this way, he’s something of a hipster himself). They’re interesting things to play Devil’s advocate with, but ultimately (luckily!) they don’t affect Mark Strong’s life, so why would anyone get worked up about them? Just <em>let it go</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I finished chapter seven and stowed Stephen King’s <em>Misery</em> in the front pocket of my backpack, leaving the pair to bicker in peace on the patio in the bright May sunshine.</p>

<h2>Halloween Comes Early at the <em>Nexus</em></h2>
</header>
<p>Dr Edwin Feliciano, a self-proclaimed “psychiatrist” at UCSB, today appears to be attempting <a href="http://dailynexus.com/2013-05-22/anatomy-of-an-overdose/" title="Anatomy of an Overdose">a séance in the pages of the <em>Nexus</em></a>, and reports to us a story told by the dead. Let us refer to the ghostly narrator as “Edwin”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am dead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the words of one commenter, <a href="http://dailynexus.com/2013-05-22/anatomy-of-an-overdose/comment-page-1/#comment-172755">“Cool story, bro.”</a></p>
<p>But how did Edwin die?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What’s one pill, man?” said my friend. “People take six of those a day for pain.” I looked at it. It was white, oval-shaped and promised a good time. Two hours later I was in bed, unable to breathe. My friends thought I was just passed out—something that happens a lot at college parties. Hell, I had seen it so many times too! Why would something go wrong then?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It shouldn’t come as a surprise that Edwin isn’t the brightest bulb, but it’s rather alarming that Dr Feliciano doesn’t pause in his spirit-channeling to point out that there are rather a lot of reasons why <em>something would go wrong</em> when a person passes out at a party. I can only assume that the good doctor knows something we don’t (and I guess that’s to be expected, given that <em>he’s</em> the one who can commune with the dead).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the doctors discussed my “case” after I died, one doc said, “This is outrageous. Too many kids die from this. How stupid can a person be?” I was angry, but I hung around and listened to their “expert analysis.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Expert” is rightly enclosed in quotation marks, because these doctors probably don’t even believe in ghosts. But more interesting are the quotes around “case”. What is Dead Edwin trying to tell us? Was there no real case? Let us proceed with caution, dear reader.</p>
<p>The dead man’s story continues with some bizarrely pedagogic ruminations on his so-called case, and the claim that “what I learned may help you stay alive.” That’s a rather strange thing to tell a doctor, but Edwin Feliciano apparently doesn’t realize that a passed-out person might be in trouble, so I suppose he could use the advice.</p>
<p>As we reach the conclusion, though, a careful reader gets the impression that this is not the monologue of a normal (if deceased) 19-year-old:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The rest of the explanation got too technical for me. By then, I didn’t care to understand the “physiological” causes of my death. It boiled down to this: there is a difference between what you feel psychologically—relaxed, buzzed, happy—and what your body is experiencing internally. While it may be easy to gauge your mood, alcohol and drugs are accumulating in your system at a rate faster than your body can metabolize them. The fact is that the effects are delayed, so when you have one more shot, or an Adderall, or a Norco, you’re creating a unique, often deadly cocktail in your body. That’s what happened to me. I got the message too late, which is, very simply, that mixing drugs will kill you, period.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I should have stayed home watching the Sixers play the Knicks and having a few beers with my friends. I didn’t, as you now know, but you have a choice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sounds less like the lament of a soul who is mourning the loss of its body than a school psychiatrist who is insulting the intelligence of his patients by making obviously false claims that lead students to dismiss his advice—and therefore be <em>more</em> likely to make risky decisions—instead of explaining accurately how common drugs interact and urging young people to educate themselves about the effects of what they put in their bodies.</p>
<p>So maybe ghosts don’t exist after all. They’re just another thing Dr Feliciano made up to scare us.</p>

<h2>How To Have Sex While Hating Yourself And Others</h2>
</header>
<p>Marissa Perez of <em>The Bottom Line</em>—the only arm of our media empire that actually does any work—today broke <a href="http://thebottomline.as.ucsb.edu/2013/05/violent-altercation-breaks-out-in-iv-provoked-by-homophobic-remarks" title="Violent Altercation Breaks Out in IV, Provoked By Homophobic Remarks">the story of a hate crime that occurred last month</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Violence broke out in Isla Vista on Trigo Road Friday, April 26, following one student directing homophobic comments toward another, reminding the campus community of the importance of creating a safe climate in and around campus.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>…</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]he student who had made the homophobic comments began “kicking [the victim’s] head repeatedly and started stomping on him,” said Aljawad. “I just wanted him to not kill the guy, so we called the cops.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This incident raises not only issues of campus climate but also the dismissive attitude the police often take toward crimes against minority groups. Law enforcement is perceived by many to take the side of those <em>perpetrating</em> hate crimes, instead of those victimized by them.</p>
<p>In the wake of this story, the <em>Nexus</em> was not silent. In today’s op-ed, Emile Nelson and R. Pengsta have a message for the <a href="http://queerumich.com/post/25021141159/lgbt-lgbtq-queer-quiltbag-gsm-gsrm-whats" title="Queer @ UMich: LGBT? LGBTQ? Queer? QUILTBAG? GSM? GSRM?">GSRM</a> community at UCSB:</p>
<p><a href="http://dailynexus.com/2013-05-15/to-hump-or-not-to-hump-he-said-she-said-edition/" title="To Hump or Not to Hump? He Said, She Said Edition"><strong>Go away.</strong></a></p>
<p>Smoothly articulating the principles behind <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=101961#renewing" title="Daily Nexus Mission Statement">the mission statement of the <em>Nexus</em></a>, Nelson and Pengsta bravely defend commonsense heterosexual values against the “compulsory homosexuality” taught in liberal universities such as UCSB. They also unapologetically reaffirm the Biblical truth that men and women are irredeemably different creatures, each incomprehensible to the other.</p>
<p>Nelson and Pengsta therefore present their polemic as a dialogue, with Pengsta as the straight woman speaking to other straight women who chase after men, and Nelson <a href="batman.html" title="Batman is Best at Everything, Including Fighting the Matriarchy">reprising his role</a> as the misogynistic fuckwit who slut-shames his female peers. Discussing the Serious Problem of having sex on a first date, Nelson <a href="http://dailynexus.com/2013-05-15/to-hump-or-not-to-hump-he-said-she-said-edition/" title="To Hump or Not to Hump? He Said, She Said Edition">pontificates finely</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[I]t’s risky to light the candles and whip out the Marvin Gaye on day one for a couple of reasons.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li>Sleaze factor: You can’t help but wonder that if she’s ready for me on day one, who else is getting this kind of treatment?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The Natural Order: It’s much easier to become friends before the first hump than it is to try to go back and get to know each other afterwards. You might feel satisfied, but you’ll probably never know if she shares your love for Batman.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Nelson is of course perfectly correct that if a woman has had sex with multiple (male!) partners she’s a worthless whore, but that point has been made more eloquently elsewhere. His second itemized bit of 19th-century wisdom is rather more original.</p>
<p>It is a truth long-forgotten that men and women can only engage in normal relations (“be friends”, to use the jargon) when they are not and have never been engaged in abnormal relations (have not “fucked each others’ brains out”)—and <a href="http://jezebel.com/5954769/for-the-love-of-god-will-we-ever-stop-asking-if-men-and-women-can-be-ever-be-just-friends" title="For the Love of God, Will We Ever Stop Asking if Men and Women Can Really Be &#39;Just Friends&#39;?">perhaps not even then!</a> Once the man has taken the woman as his, she is no longer his equal and it is inappropriate and emasculating for him to “talk to her” and “care about her opinion” concerning Batman and similarly intellectual subjects.</p>
<p>So, by-definition-heterosexual <strong>Ladies:</strong> do you want to talk about Batman with Emile Nelson? Then for the love of God, don’t have sex with him. But don’t have sex with anyone else either, since that would make you a ruined trollop, unworthy of his attention.</p>
<p>Maybe just don’t talk to Emile Nelson.</p>

<h2>If Thomas Friedman and Matthew Yglesias Had a Child, That Child Would Be Mark Strong</h2>
</header>
<p>There is nothing like some bold, contrarian thinking to shake up the stale Washington consensus. Noted <a href="http://www.eschatonblog.com/2012/04/one-true-wanker-of-decade.html" title="Thomas Friedman: The One True Wanker of the Decade">wanker</a> Thomas Friedman is perhaps the finest practitioner of this art, the apogee of his career being his bold and contrarian suggestion that <a href="http://www.salon.com/2009/01/14/friedman_7/" title="Tom Friedman offers a perfect definition of &quot;terrorism&quot;">Israel terrorize the Palestinian population</a>. This quite <em>new</em> idea took many by surprise, but has since been adopted by the IDF to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Cast_Lead" title="Wikipedia: Operation Cast Lead">great effect</a>. Matthew Yglesias is part of a younger generation of wankers, but has risen rapidly in stature since his inspired defense of <a href="http://www.mrdestructo.com/2013/04/destructo-salon-does-matthew-yglesias.html" title="Destructo Salon: Does Matthew Yglesias Enjoy Murder?">collapsing buildings on poor people in exchange for cheap denim</a>.</p>
<p>Though these wankers will eventually retire and die, there is no shortage of young wankers willing and ready to replace them, as Mark Strong proves today. Faced with the classic tension between “optimists” and “pessimists” and their disagreements over whether things are getting better or worse, Strong makes the brilliant proposal that we simply <a href="http://dailynexus.com/2013-05-09/eternal-optimism-and-pessimism-both-impediments-to-human-progress/" title="Eternal Optimism and Pessimism, Both Impediments to Human Progress?">stop caring about right and wrong</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whereas a pessimist sees the glass half-empty and an optimist sees the glass half-full, a pragmatist simply observes the glass and its contents and determines its maximum utility. Moral judgments are cut neatly out of the evaluation. The situation is neither good nor bad; the situation just is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a truly divine bit of wanking. Strong pushes aside the sentimental fools who cling to “principles” and presents his pseudo-utilitarian neoliberalism as <em>the</em> detached, rational worldview, unsullied by any sort of emotional attachment to the millions oppressed by his beloved “bipartisan consensus”.</p>
<p>Near the end of his pitch for <em>The World is Really Fucking Flat, Or: I Want a Big House Like Tom Friedman</em>, Strong shows that his writing is just as horrific as that of his spiritual father:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While we’re all entitled to our respective opinions, there is no productive value in the belief that humanity is headed for a cliff on a runaway train. The same goes for plugging our ears with wax and tying ourselves to the mast. Ship, train, plane or blimp—whatever comparative vessel you prefer, if we don’t do something, it’s going to crash.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mark Strong’s future looks bright. The rest of us are fucked.</p>

<h2>Stop Making Sense (feat. Ben Moss)</h2>
</header>
<p><em>Daily Nexus</em> writer Ben Moss, having failed to think of anything interesting to write about in his Tuesday column, resigned himself to authoring <a href="http://dailynexus.com/2013-05-07/51217/" title="&lt;3-to-&lt;3 in Ones and Zeroes">a thinkpiece on clickbait</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was mindlessly browsing the internet the other day, as one does, and I came across an article promising to reveal the 21st century’s sexiest career. I must say, I never expected Yahoo! Finance to be so infatuated with “data scientists.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yahoo! is refreshingly upfront about the disingenuous nature of their article, admitting that to take it seriously <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/daily-ticker/sexiest-job-21st-century-122238562.html" title="Yahoo! Finance: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century">“you have to buy the logic that what makes a career ‘sexy’ is when demand for your skills outstrips supply, allowing you to command a sizable paycheck and options.”</a> This is bullshit, of course, and Ben Moss could have used this quote to segue into a discussion of the sort of soulless careerism that leads people into believing that the best job is the one that pays the most. But this being the <em>Nexus</em>, we instead get something bizarre and completely inane.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The more I think about data science, the more I see its sexiness is obvious to our place in time. Data is no longer boring, as I thought it once was. Just look at UCSB. Here, our friends fight bitterly to study accounting, we’re asked to fill out surveys every time we check our emails and our perm numbers are (as ugly as it sounds to say) crucial to our identity as students.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nothing turns Ben on more than turning <em>off</em> his roommate’s alarm in order to get a spot in ECON 3B; it’s positively orgasmic. And the second-best part of his day is when he hears that SurveyMonkey cares so much about his opinion that it reaches out to him <em>in person!</em> (This is because nobody else does.)</p>
<p>Next, Ben addresses the question of <em>why</em> he gets so horned up thinking about MySQL tables:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My take on the paradigm shift is a little different. I think it’s about the role data has played in our growing up and the way we use it so extensively now. After all, we’ve all sent off a meaningful email or an emotional text. We’ve all proudly fashioned our Facebook profiles to mean something about who we are. In one way or another, we’ve all had a heart-to-heart in the ones and zeroes of computer programming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ben is a living testament to the truth of Marshall McLuhan’s famous dictum that “the medium is the message.” He is unable to separate the content of what he writes from the medium in which he composes it. While researching this column, an anonymous source provided me with one of Ben Moss’ sexts, and you can see for yourself what living in this digital environment has done to Ben’s ideas of romance:</p>
<pre class="js"><code>for ( var i=0; i &lt; 5; i++ ) {
  if ( i % 2 === 0 ) {
    alert(&quot;I love you&quot;);
  }
  else {
    alert(&quot;I love you not&quot;);
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>(His deep immersion into digital media has also apparently erased the distinction in his mind between “data” and “the ones and zeroes of computer programming.”)</p>
<p>In the conclusion of his essay, Ben finally recognizes his digital addiction and vows to make a change:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But I do think we need to make a practice of diplomacy, as it may not come as naturally in the digital age. There’s still something intangible and more effective about spoken interaction, especially when something is being negotiated. When emailing, you have to concern yourself with precision in language, exactness in tone and concision in length. Moreover, emails are easy to delete. Negotiating in person can actually save time and grief because arguably the human face is so innately appealing that it’s hard to reject.</p>
<p>Personally, I’m actually trying to include less and less meaning in my emails. I’m trying to make them vague and unclear. The less I send electronically, the less I find myself attracted to data, the less I leave myself open to digital criticism, the less—in fact—I foresee a future in cold, robotic shades.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As if anticipating this very piece, Ben Moss here declares his intention to <em>stop making sense</em> in order to avoid the relentless “digital criticism” that <a href="drama.html" title="An Unlikely Friendship">last week led the <em>Nexus</em> to surrender to the <em>Nonsense</em></a> and become a subsidiary of our media empire, a misbehaving pet that we continue to scold. We look forward to publishing Moss’ next column, which will consist of epic poetry written only with consonants.</p>
<p>As of press time, Ben replied to his mother’s text about his phone bill with “Forever six times have I killed the wurm. Life is death and worse.”</p>

<h2>The Strawman That Broke The Camel’s Back</h2>
</header>
<blockquote>
<p>“I love apps. I have downloaded so, so many of them.” — <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/229576" title="Forget Constant Communication, This App Offers Instant Communication">Kyle Richey, Millennial</a></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Millennials love apps. We make Tweets, we Tumbl, and Snap Chat with each other all day long. We also love President Obama. Like, <a href="http://wonkette.com/498120/why-spend-17-95-on-erotic-obama-fan-fic-when-you-can-get-your-cow-for-free" title="Why Spend $17.95 On &#39;Erotic&#39; Obama Fan-Fic, When You Can Get Your Cow At Wonket For Free?">a lot</a>. So we were very excited when we learned that Obama was making an <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/">app</a>. An app made by Obama would be the combination of the two things we love — Obama and apps.</p>
<p>But Obama did not make a good app. His app is not the next Snap Chat. It is not snappy. It is bad. Obama’s bad app has left us Millennials feeling betrayed and very sad. <a href="http://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/breaking-the-second-term-curse/" title="Breaking the Second Term Curse">And angry</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to avoid this topic, I did. But I can only sit around for so long while Jon Stewart, NPR and the New York Times — basically all of my closest friends — tear one of my biggest heroes apart. This has been heartbreaking for me. And for all of the times that I have blindly supported Obama, though I will never admit to actually ever being false, today I cannot ignore our president’s decisions simply because I am really inspired by Michelle Obama’s gnarly biceps and triceps. Today is the day I never expected to see. Today I will critique the actions of President Barack Obama.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These words are coming from a Millennial, so they should concern President Obama. Especially because even though this Millennial is writing under the name “Mckinley Krongaus” she is probably actually <a href="http://youtu.be/o6G3nwhPuR4">Lena Dunham</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am debatably President Obama’s biggest fan. I am constantly tweeting inappropriate fantasies of wishing to bear his children and quite frankly, I don’t know why the National Security Agency hasn’t checked up on me yet. The newspaper cover from that heavenly day in November 2008 remains tacked on my closet door at home and I will forever remember the incredible feeling I had as I gave up my voting virginity for him aside a stripper pole at the lovely AEPi house. But holy shit, is he dicking around right now, or what?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One reason why Millennials are not happy about Obama’s app is that a cool feature was removed that we really wanted. <a href="http://wonkette.com/532898/obamas-you-can-keep-your-plan-failed-to-anticipate-how-much-americans-love-cheap-crappy-plans-that-cover-nothing" title="Obama’s &#39;You Can Keep Your Plan&#39; Failed To Anticipate How Much Americans Love Cheap Crappy Plans That Cover Nothing">We wanted to be able to be fucked over by insurance companies</a>, and Obama’s app doesn’t let us do that (no wait it was just <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2013/11/obamacare-keep-your-insurance-plan">updated</a>, we’re all good).</p>
<p>But that’s not the only reason we Millennials are mad. We’re also mad because the Obama app is not a good app:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On my bike ride to class yesterday morning I was listening to NPR’s “Morning Edition” (yes, I’m that person) and heard a ridiculous story about these three guys in the Silicon Valley who were fed up with the terrible setup of the healthcare website and sat down and literally made their own. It’s called healthsherpa.com and so far it’s helped to provide thousands of users with insurance quotes that they couldn’t get access to on the actual Affordable Care Act website. One of the programmers said that about 85 percent of their website’s users have been able to complete the process of finding a plan that works for them compared to the humorously praised number of 100,000 Americans that have chosen plans on the real website. Reality check: There are 40 million uninsured Americans and we’re pretending to be stoked on 100,000 being able to even make their way through the website all the way? The moral of the story was that three dudes under the age of 30 created a website that is more functional than the website brain-child of the entire federal government. That’s a little silly, don’t you think?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lena Dunham is a Millennial, so she <a href="https://medium.com/funny-stuff/d7e5d14065f1" title="Dear Miss Disruption">learned to code</a> and knows some things:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Move fast and break things</p></li>
<li><p>Always be shipping</p></li>
<li><p>Disrupt the industry</p></li>
<li><p>Innovation</p></li>
<li><p>Pivot</p></li>
<li><p>“Entrepreneur”</p></li>
<li><p>Horse_ebooks</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Obama’s app did not break things. Obama’s app is broken. It’s not the same thing, and Obama’s app is the bad one. Also it did not move fast. Obama’s app is slow. The Health Sherpa is a good app because it was made by Millennial. It also has vision. <a href="http://e-pluribusunum.com/2013/11/11/why-healthsherpa-com-is-not-a-replacement-for-healthcare-gov/">It does one thing</a> and does it well. Obama’s app tries to do too many things. That’s bad. The Health Sherpa worked for 85 percent of its users. Obama’s app only worked for 100,000.</p>
<p>100,000 is less than 85 percent. That’s bad for Obama and his app.</p>
<p>Obama’s app <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/10/why-the-healthcaregov-train-wreck-happened-in-slow-motion.html" title="Healthcare.gov: It Could Be Worse">could not have been worse</a>. It’s as bad as the hurricane that <a href="http://www.esquire.com/blogs/politics/Things_That_Are_Not_Like_Each_Other" title="Nobody Drowned From Obamacare">killed a lot of people</a>. Obama’s app might be killing people too maybe:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>
obamacare is a fuckin trainwreck. kids with cancer don't even want insurance now. “the website is bad,” they said, dying. “its too slow”

<h2>CONSTANT VIGILANCE!</h2>
</header>
<p><em>The Bottom Line</em>, the flagship publication of <a href="drama.html" title="An Unlikely Friendship">our media empire</a>, has a fine record of <a href="who.html" title="There&#39;s No Woman Good Enough To Play Dr. Who But There Are Strong Female Characters So Shut It">standing athwart history</a>. This week that tradition was honored by Madison Donahue-Wolfe, who steals the Complain-About-Technology crown from <a href="sexy.html" title="Stop Making Sense (feat. Ben Moss)">Ben Moss</a> with <a href="http://thebottomline.as.ucsb.edu/2013/10/smartphones-how-being-constantly-connected-can-have-deathly-consequences" title="Smartphones: How Being Constantly Connected Can Have Deathly Consequences">this deep insight</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As technology surges forward, and companies develop more involved and even wearable products, such as Google Glass, slated for release sometime in 2014, you must ask yourself whether being so connected to the web, to your friends, and to your device makes you in turn more disconnected from the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You must, you must, <strong>You Must,</strong> because our sudden immersion in “tech”, something that has <a href="http://punch.photoshelter.com/image/I00006GHuH4c0Ojo">only just now occurred</a>, leaves us alienated and miserable, as a recent poll discovered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This report [by Kleiner Perkins Caulfield &amp; Byers] went on to state that when asked how social and communication activities on smartphones made them feel, the two most common feelings users responded with were “connected” and “excited.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are now so “connected” and “excited” that we have ceased to sit and stare at fellow passengers while riding trains, keeping an eye out for guns and wondering when somebody will get around to inventing the printing press so we can fucking read a book or something because this commute feels like forever.</p>

<h2>There’s No Woman Good Enough To Play Dr. Who But There Are Strong Female Characters So Shut It</h2>
</header>
<p>The blogosphere let out a collective <em>jolly good</em> earlier this month upon learning that a white gentleman had been selected to represent Doctor Who in <em>his</em> eponymous television show. God continues to save the Queen.</p>
<p>True devotees of the television event had understandably been rather worked up in advance of the announcement, for there had been a number of outrageous rumors and suggestions regarding the nature of the future Doctor. <a href="http://thebottomline.as.ucsb.edu/2013/08/peter-capaldi-is-great-but-its-time-for-a-change/comment-page-1#comment-970526">Insufficiently British</a> commentators had the gall to imagine the venerable man as something quite unsuitable—namely, a man of color or, worse, a woman!</p>
<figure>
<iframe src="http://giphy.com/embed/YTRMdFNmWVYhq" width="300" height="225" frameBorder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>
</figure>

<p>Fortunately, cooler (and paler) heads prevailed, and one “Peter Capaldi” was selected to carry on the white man’s burden of pretending to be an alien on television. But even with the question of “diversity” settled forever, there are still some who insist on <a href="http://thebottomline.as.ucsb.edu/2013/08/peter-capaldi-is-great-but-its-time-for-a-change" title="Beth Askins: Peter Capaldi Is Great, But It&#39;s Time For A Change">picking up pitchforks</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m not saying Peter Capaldi isn’t talented. I’m not saying we should all riot with pitchforks and torches against the casting director. And I’m certainly not saying I haven’t loved the previous doctors. All I’m saying is, it’s about time for a little change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fortunately, <a href="http://thebottomline.as.ucsb.edu/2013/08/should-the-doctor-be-doctored" title="Should the Doctor be Doctored?">Coleman Gray comes out swinging</a> in today’s <em>Bottom Line</em> against this outrageous attempt to undermine one of the last opportunities for white male employment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The recent Doctors of Eccleston, Tennant, and Smith have all been excellent actors, and I would like to think that all future regenerations will feature similarly talented actors chosen based on performance alone. Even though the casting of a female or racially diverse Doctor might be appreciated by some, I would be just as excited and apprehensive as I am over the casting of any other new replacement actor. But, if they were to cast an individual because of the grumblings of an upset minority and not because of acting talent, it would be a mistake. After all, as a creature nearly a millennium old and bouncing about the utter limits of both time and space, the Doctor should be above current political and social trends.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Gray admits that “there are many strong female and racially diverse characters” in the series, but points out that while female and racially diverse actors do a good enough job in supporting roles, they just aren’t as good as white men. The choice of a woman and/or person of color to play Doctor Who would be a politicized choice, biased by current social trends, in a way that the selection of a white man is not. Decades from now, we will look back and laugh at the idea that a creature nearly a millennium old and bouncing about the utter limits of both time and space could ever be accurately portrayed by anyone but a white man from a small island in the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Because trends come and go, but white men are forever.</p>

<h2>Boys Will Be Boys And Girls Must Be Girls</h2>
</header>
<p>The last time our worthless <a href="drama.html" title="An Unlikely Friendship">subsidiary</a> bothered to publish something this summer, we were alarmed to find that it was an unapologetically <a href="hurdle.html" title="The War On Men Continues">misandrist screed</a> against the right of men to do whatever they want without jeopardizing the sex that is also a thing that they have a right to. We at <em>The Daily Nonsense</em> apologize for allowing “Haley K.” a soapbox for her outrageous opinions, and are happy to announce that we have replaced her with “Hayley E.”, who this week has rescued the <em>Nexus</em> tradition of blaming everything on women.</p>
<p><a href="http://dailynexus.com/2013-08-07/some-things-are-better-left-in-the-bedroom/" title="Some Things are Better Left in the Bedroom">Hayley is concerned in her column</a> about Lulu, a relatively new app that allows women to anonymously review men in a way that’s been described as <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/katieheaney/the-girls-only-yelp-for-boys" title="Katie Heaney: The Girls-Only Yelp For Boys">“Yelp for boys”</a>. Hayley sees the app as part of the ongoing coarsening of our values, driven—of course—by fragile womanly natures:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, I fully understand why an app like this was created: Some girl probably got cheated on and said something along the lines of, “My fragile womanly heart has burst asunder! If only other women knew the scheming cruel ways of Bobby Whatshisface!” Were these the good old days, she would’ve drenched his possessions in gasoline, lined them up in the yard to spell “ballface” or “douchenozzle,” and then lit them up like the Fourth of July. But nowadays, such a simple act of rebellion does not seem to go far enough in sending a message to the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At first this may seem like an unintuitive conclusion, for one imagines that most men would prefer to retain their possessions than have the #FartMachine hashtag applied to them at OnLulu Dot Com. But as Hayley argues, things can be replaced, but a ruined reputation is forever:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We live in an age where everything we do is permanently stored on the internet. That dorky MySpace profile picture where you had braces and wore your pants too high? It’s up there. That video where you tried to do a sexy dance and instead ended up totally eating it? It’s somewhere in the bowels of the web … or, if you’re really unlucky, on the front page of YouTube. And your romantic endeavors, gross habits and/or traits you’d hoped would never leave the bedroom? Yep. If you’re a man, these, too, are readily available to the public eye thanks to Lulu. Guys, be afraid … be very afraid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before you think that this is overly dramatic, that surely guys shouldn’t worry about anonymous review of dubious authenticity posted on a single website—Hayley E. would like to remind you that women are uniformly shallow and mindless, and will often ignore their own judgment because of something a stranger said on the internet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If my little brother falls for a girl in the future and she decides to look him up on Lulu before their date, she’s going to spend the whole time thinking about his hashtags, judgments fully formed before so much as talking to him. She’ll look specifically for those attributes and faults, and when he does something that matches his description, she’ll feel like everything on the page has been validated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The danger is clear: this perverse and unaccountable system has the power to render legions of men <a href="https://twitter.com/puahate_txt/status/354601082309185536" title="Tweet from @PUAHate_txt on 9 July 2013">incel</a>, and angry. But there may be a risk to women as well, apart from the possibility of <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Men_Going_Their_Own_Way" title="Entry for &quot;Men Going Their Own Way&quot; on RationalWiki">men going their own way</a>. Men may <em>strike back</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If action isn’t taken against Lulu, it’s only a matter of time before there is a male equivalent. Right now it exists by word of mouth in places like locker rooms, bars and dorms, where towels are rat-tailed and there’s talk of “tapping that.” But soon they could be detailing your nastiest girl habits and that weird thing you did in bed (even if it was just that once) for the whole guy-world to see.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s true: if we’re not careful, men might get ideas and start shaming women on the internet. Until now they have been kept in check, following the virtuous example set by women. But now, Hayley worries, women may not be women anymore: they have abdicated their responsibility of reining in male libidos that are too great for men to control by themselves. Now that men see themselves betrayed by women, who knows what they might do?</p>
<p>Perhaps a version of Lulu that allows men to rate women they know. But men’s righteous anger may carry them further. Although not wanting to generalize, Hayley generalizes about men’s likely behavior, saying: “Not to generalize, but I imagine men would be inclined to be a tad more explicit with their posts on your page.” She may be right, however. It’s within the realm of <em>possibility</em> that they might not only leave “reviews” of women, but upload <a href="http://betabeat.com/2012/10/creepshots-reemerges-under-the-guise-of-a-fashion-police-subreddit/" title="Jessica Roy: Creepshots Reemerges Under the Guise of a &#39;Fashion Police&#39; Subreddit">candid photographs</a> of them, publish their <a href="http://gawker.com/5961208/revenge+porn-troll-hunter-moore-wants-to-publish-your-nudes-alongside-directions-to-your-house" title="Camille Dodero: Revenge-Porn Troll Hunter Moore Wants To Publish Your Nudes With Directions to Your House">personal information</a>, and even encourage <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_of_Amanda_Todd" title="Wikipedia: Suicide of Amanda Todd">ruthless bullying</a>.</p>
<p>It’s <em>possible</em> that all this could happen. So women, <em>shape up</em>. Because <em>if</em> it does happen, it will be your fault for using a novelty app in order to say that a guy is #Boring.</p>

<h2>The War On Men Continues</h2>
</header>
<p>During Emile Nelson’s tenure at the <em>Nexus</em>, great gains have been made for Men’s Rights. He established himself as a leader of the <a href="http://www.involuntarycelibacy.com/" title="The Incel Project">incel movement</a> by eloquently explaining how sex is, for the male, often <a href="batman.html" title="Batman is Best at Everything, Including Fighting the Matriarchy"><em>an act of self-defense</em></a>. The truth of this is clearly shown by the following lament from a man who has found himself involuntarily celibate:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>
Being incel really fucks you up. Not only do you not get to have sex, but you also develop bizarre fetishes and usually become racist.
</p>
— Puahate.txt (<span class="citation" data-cites="puahate_txt">@puahate_txt</span>) <a href="https://twitter.com/puahate_txt/statuses/336300385478275072">May 20, 2013</a>
</blockquote>

<p>But Mister Nelson also did a great service to mankind by developing a cogent argument to the effect that <a href="hump.html" title="How To Have Sex While Hating Yourself And Others">women who are not virgins have profound mental handicaps</a>. By setting forth these truths, he dealt a serious blow to the misandrist goal of subjugating men under the promiscuous heel of a woman.</p>
<p>Lord Nelson appears to have taken a well-deserved break over the summer, though, and in his absence trouble is brewing. Known misandrist “Haley K.” has used her bully pulpit at the <em>Nexus</em> to <a href="http://dailynexus.com/2013-06-26/the-hurdles-to-jump-before-you-hump/" title="The Hurdles to Jump Before You Hump">shame men into once more obeying female whims</a>. But we stand in solidarity with Emile Nelson and say, “Never Again!”</p>
<p>Haley betrays her agenda early on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although the basic standards for guys are much less demanding, many still struggle with taking the deceptively simple steps necessary to get laid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Deceptively simple”? Has Haley K. never heard the heart-wrenching testimony of <a href="https://governmentsgetgirlfriends.wordpress.com/2013/02/01/my-parents-criminals-who-deserve-to-be-put-in-jail-or-killed/" title="My parents --- criminals who deserve to be put in jail or killed">those men who have been reduced to asking the government to find them a partner</a>? The suffering of these poor souls will not be alleviated by buying into matriarchal beauty standards. “Proper pants” and “great hair” are merely further tools of oppression. And don’t get me started on chivalry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Okay, so it’s old-fashioned, but everyone loves a knight in shining armor. Hold the door open, offer up your jacket on those cold nights, give a compliment here and there and remember that the occasional bouquet of flowers never hurt anybody. Go the extra mile so that they will too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Men are being asked to follow arcane rules steeped in misandry in exchange for the sex that they are owed! Haley is treating women as if they were slot machines that release sex when the right combination of compliments and flowers are supplied. But as any <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/mensrights" title="/r/mensrights">MRA</a> will tell you, that is not the right way of looking at things. Rather, women should be seen as the candy in those little bowls at banks that you can take even if you aren’t depositing any money. You deserve it, just for showing up!</p>
<p>Let us pray that Emile Nelson returns to us and preaches these truths again.</p>

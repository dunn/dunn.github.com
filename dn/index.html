<h2>There’s No Woman Good Enough To Play Dr. Who But There Are Strong Female Characters So Shut It</h2>
</header>
<p>The blogosphere let out a collective <em>jolly good</em> earlier this month upon learning that a white gentleman had been selected to represent Doctor Who in <em>his</em> eponymous television show. God continues to save the Queen.</p>
<p>True devotees of the television event had understandably been rather worked up in advance of the announcement, for there had been a number of outrageous rumors and suggestions regarding the nature of the future Doctor. <a href="http://thebottomline.as.ucsb.edu/2013/08/peter-capaldi-is-great-but-its-time-for-a-change/comment-page-1#comment-970526">Insufficiently British</a> commentators had the gall to imagine the venerable man as something quite unsuitable—namely, a man of color or, worse, a woman!</p>
<figure>
<iframe src="http://giphy.com/embed/YTRMdFNmWVYhq" width="300" height="225" frameBorder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>
</figure>

<p>Fortunately, cooler (and paler) heads prevailed, and one “Peter Capaldi” was selected to carry on the white man’s burden of pretending to be an alien on television. But even with the question of “diversity” settled forever, there are still some who insist on <a href="http://thebottomline.as.ucsb.edu/2013/08/peter-capaldi-is-great-but-its-time-for-a-change" title="Beth Askins: Peter Capaldi Is Great, But It&#39;s Time For A Change">picking up pitchforks</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m not saying Peter Capaldi isn’t talented. I’m not saying we should all riot with pitchforks and torches against the casting director. And I’m certainly not saying I haven’t loved the previous doctors. All I’m saying is, it’s about time for a little change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fortunately, <a href="http://thebottomline.as.ucsb.edu/2013/08/should-the-doctor-be-doctored" title="Should the Doctor be Doctored?">Coleman Gray comes out swinging</a> in today’s <em>Bottom Line</em> against this outrageous attempt to undermine one of the last opportunities for white male employment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The recent Doctors of Eccleston, Tennant, and Smith have all been excellent actors, and I would like to think that all future regenerations will feature similarly talented actors chosen based on performance alone. Even though the casting of a female or racially diverse Doctor might be appreciated by some, I would be just as excited and apprehensive as I am over the casting of any other new replacement actor. But, if they were to cast an individual because of the grumblings of an upset minority and not because of acting talent, it would be a mistake. After all, as a creature nearly a millennium old and bouncing about the utter limits of both time and space, the Doctor should be above current political and social trends.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Gray admits that “there are many strong female and racially diverse characters” in the series, but points out that while female and racially diverse actors do a good enough job in supporting roles, they just aren’t as good as white men. The choice of a woman and/or person of color to play Doctor Who would be a politicized choice, biased by current social trends, in a way that the selection of a white man is not. Decades from now, we will look back and laugh at the idea that a creature nearly a millennium old and bouncing about the utter limits of both time and space could ever be accurately portrayed by anyone but a white man from a small island in the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Because trends come and go, but white men are forever.</p>

<h2>Boys Will Be Boys And Girls Must Be Girls</h2>
</header>
<p>The last time our worthless <a href="drama.html" title="An Unlikely Friendship">subsidiary</a> bothered to publish something this summer, we were alarmed to find that it was an unapologetically <a href="hurdle.html" title="The War On Men Continues">misandrist screed</a> against the right of men to do whatever they want without jeopardizing the sex that is also a thing that they have a right to. We at <em>The Daily Nonsense</em> apologize for allowing “Haley K.” a soapbox for her outrageous opinions, and are happy to announce that we have replaced her with “Hayley E.”, who this week has rescued the <em>Nexus</em> tradition of blaming everything on women.</p>
<p><a href="http://dailynexus.com/2013-08-07/some-things-are-better-left-in-the-bedroom/" title="Some Things are Better Left in the Bedroom">Hayley is concerned in her column</a> about Lulu, a relatively new app that allows women to anonymously review men in a way that’s been described as <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/katieheaney/the-girls-only-yelp-for-boys" title="Katie Heaney: The Girls-Only Yelp For Boys">“Yelp for boys”</a>. Hayley sees the app as part of the ongoing coarsening of our values, driven—of course—by fragile womanly natures:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, I fully understand why an app like this was created: Some girl probably got cheated on and said something along the lines of, “My fragile womanly heart has burst asunder! If only other women knew the scheming cruel ways of Bobby Whatshisface!” Were these the good old days, she would’ve drenched his possessions in gasoline, lined them up in the yard to spell “ballface” or “douchenozzle,” and then lit them up like the Fourth of July. But nowadays, such a simple act of rebellion does not seem to go far enough in sending a message to the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At first this may seem like an unintuitive conclusion, for one imagines that most men would prefer to retain their possessions than have the #FartMachine hashtag applied to them at OnLulu Dot Com. But as Hayley argues, things can be replaced, but a ruined reputation is forever:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We live in an age where everything we do is permanently stored on the internet. That dorky MySpace profile picture where you had braces and wore your pants too high? It’s up there. That video where you tried to do a sexy dance and instead ended up totally eating it? It’s somewhere in the bowels of the web … or, if you’re really unlucky, on the front page of YouTube. And your romantic endeavors, gross habits and/or traits you’d hoped would never leave the bedroom? Yep. If you’re a man, these, too, are readily available to the public eye thanks to Lulu. Guys, be afraid … be very afraid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before you think that this is overly dramatic, that surely guys shouldn’t worry about anonymous review of dubious authenticity posted on a single website—Hayley E. would like to remind you that women are uniformly shallow and mindless, and will often ignore their own judgment because of something a stranger said on the internet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If my little brother falls for a girl in the future and she decides to look him up on Lulu before their date, she’s going to spend the whole time thinking about his hashtags, judgments fully formed before so much as talking to him. She’ll look specifically for those attributes and faults, and when he does something that matches his description, she’ll feel like everything on the page has been validated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The danger is clear: this perverse and unaccountable system has the power to render legions of men <a href="https://twitter.com/puahate_txt/status/354601082309185536" title="Tweet from @PUAHate_txt on 9 July 2013">incel</a>, and angry. But there may be a risk to women as well, apart from the possibility of <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Men_Going_Their_Own_Way" title="Entry for &quot;Men Going Their Own Way&quot; on RationalWiki">men going their own way</a>. Men may <em>strike back</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If action isn’t taken against Lulu, it’s only a matter of time before there is a male equivalent. Right now it exists by word of mouth in places like locker rooms, bars and dorms, where towels are rat-tailed and there’s talk of “tapping that.” But soon they could be detailing your nastiest girl habits and that weird thing you did in bed (even if it was just that once) for the whole guy-world to see.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s true: if we’re not careful, men might get ideas and start shaming women on the internet. Until now they have been kept in check, following the virtuous example set by women. But now, Hayley worries, women may not be women anymore: they have abdicated their responsibility of reining in male libidos that are too great for men to control by themselves. Now that men see themselves betrayed by women, who knows what they might do?</p>
<p>Perhaps a version of Lulu that allows men to rate women they know. But men’s righteous anger may carry them further. Although not wanting to generalize, Hayley generalizes about men’s likely behavior, saying: “Not to generalize, but I imagine men would be inclined to be a tad more explicit with their posts on your page.” She may be right, however. It’s within the realm of <em>possibility</em> that they might not only leave “reviews” of women, but upload <a href="http://betabeat.com/2012/10/creepshots-reemerges-under-the-guise-of-a-fashion-police-subreddit/" title="Jessica Roy: Creepshots Reemerges Under the Guise of a &#39;Fashion Police&#39; Subreddit">candid photographs</a> of them, publish their <a href="http://gawker.com/5961208/revenge+porn-troll-hunter-moore-wants-to-publish-your-nudes-alongside-directions-to-your-house" title="Camille Dodero: Revenge-Porn Troll Hunter Moore Wants To Publish Your Nudes With Directions to Your House">personal information</a>, and even encourage <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_of_Amanda_Todd" title="Wikipedia: Suicide of Amanda Todd">ruthless bullying</a>.</p>
<p>It’s <em>possible</em> that all this could happen. So women, <em>shape up</em>. Because <em>if</em> it does happen, it will be your fault for using a novelty app in order to say that a guy is #Boring.</p>

<h2>The War On Men Continues</h2>
</header>
<p>During Emile Nelson’s tenure at the <em>Nexus</em>, great gains have been made for Men’s Rights. He established himself as a leader of the <a href="http://www.involuntarycelibacy.com/" title="The Incel Project">incel movement</a> by eloquently explaining how sex is, for the male, often <a href="batman.html" title="Batman is Best at Everything, Including Fighting the Matriarchy"><em>an act of self-defense</em></a>. The truth of this is clearly shown by the following lament from a man who has found himself involuntarily celibate:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>
Being incel really fucks you up. Not only do you not get to have sex, but you also develop bizarre fetishes and usually become racist.
</p>
— Puahate.txt (@puahate_txt) <a href="https://twitter.com/puahate_txt/statuses/336300385478275072">May 20, 2013</a>
</blockquote>

<p>But Mister Nelson also did a great service to mankind by developing a cogent argument to the effect that <a href="hump.html" title="How To Have Sex While Hating Yourself And Others">women who are not virgins have profound mental handicaps</a>. By setting forth these truths, he dealt a serious blow to the misandrist goal of subjugating men under the promiscuous heel of a woman.</p>
<p>Lord Nelson appears to have taken a well-deserved break over the summer, though, and in his absence trouble is brewing. Known misandrist “Haley K.” has used her bully pulpit at the <em>Nexus</em> to <a href="http://dailynexus.com/2013-06-26/the-hurdles-to-jump-before-you-hump/" title="The Hurdles to Jump Before You Hump">shame men into once more obeying female whims</a>. But we stand in solidarity with Emile Nelson and say, “Never Again!”</p>
<p>Haley betrays her agenda early on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although the basic standards for guys are much less demanding, many still struggle with taking the deceptively simple steps necessary to get laid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Deceptively simple”? Has Haley K. never heard the heart-wrenching testimony of <a href="https://governmentsgetgirlfriends.wordpress.com/2013/02/01/my-parents-criminals-who-deserve-to-be-put-in-jail-or-killed/" title="My parents --- criminals who deserve to be put in jail or killed">those men who have been reduced to asking the government to find them a partner</a>? The suffering of these poor souls will not be alleviated by buying into matriarchal beauty standards. “Proper pants” and “great hair” are merely further tools of oppression. And don’t get me started on chivalry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Okay, so it’s old-fashioned, but everyone loves a knight in shining armor. Hold the door open, offer up your jacket on those cold nights, give a compliment here and there and remember that the occasional bouquet of flowers never hurt anybody. Go the extra mile so that they will too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Men are being asked to follow arcane rules steeped in misandry in exchange for the sex that they are owed! Haley is treating women as if they were slot machines that release sex when the right combination of compliments and flowers are supplied. But as any <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/mensrights" title="/r/mensrights">MRA</a> will tell you, that is not the right way of looking at things. Rather, women should be seen as the candy in those little bowls at banks that you can take even if you aren’t depositing any money. You deserve it, just for showing up!</p>
<p>Let us pray that Emile Nelson returns to us and preaches these truths again.</p>

<h2>We Hardly Knew You</h2>
</header>
<p>It’s a sad day. Mr Jeffrey Robin, whose intriguing piece of analytic philosophy was the subject of <a href="robin.html" title="Critical discussion of a metaphysical thesis recently proposed by Mr. Robin">the very first essay published by the <em>Nonsense</em></a>, is stepping down from his position as Reactionary Bigot at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>
<p>He begins with some <a href="http://dailynexus.com/2013-05-28/right-side-columnist-bids-ucsb-farewell/" title="Right-Side Columnist Bids UCSB Farewell">misty-eyed remembrances</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ll be perfectly honest—UCSB wasn’t my first choice, by far. I came out of high school the preppy, sarcastic valedictorian of a sleepy suburb no one’s heard of. Despite receiving the Regents Scholarship here, I was sure that I was off to Pomona College in Claremont.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being valedictorian of an entire suburb is a remarkable accomplishment, and while I share Mr Robin’s astonishment that he was not accepted at a more prestigious institution, I am incredibly grateful that we at UCSB have been blessed with his presence. It seems that he, too, has gained from his association with public-school leeches:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Getting waitlisted at every private school I wanted to go to gave me the greatest lesson in humility I think I have ever experienced. But as I sit here writing an article I’ve been thinking about for months, I don’t think I could be more glad for it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My time at UCSB has profoundly changed me in ways I could never have anticipated. It flipped me upside down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such is the power of education. When you leave your sleepy suburb and enter a state university, not only are you exposed to new ideas in your classes, but you come into contact with <em>people</em> that you haven’t met before, people whose backgrounds and worldviews differ sharply from your own. Being able to learn from the experiences of others, especially from those less privileged than yourself, is a huge opportunity to become a better and more tolerant person.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I could not even imagine myself listening to country music. Now, country line and swing dancing is the single most time-consuming hobby I have. Once the prudish, smart-guy type who confused everyone with his diction, I’ve caught myself using the word “brah” perhaps a little more than I’d like.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But perhaps my personal beliefs have undergone the greatest and most counterintuitive changes. I came here convinced of Ayn Randian philosophy and pure libertarian ideology, totally having bought in to the populism of Ron Paul (Tea Party before it was cool). Now, perhaps to your chagrin, I am the strictest of elitist constitutional conservatives, an advocate of the Empire of Liberty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Truly a wrenching change! I can hardly imagine a situation better described as being “flipped upside down”, except perhaps the transformation involved in moving from the Socialist Equality Party to the International Socialist Organization (a process that invariably destroys friendships).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most importantly, in a time when many in our country are increasingly antagonistic to the idea of God, I moved from a tepid agnosticist and occasional deist to a strong believer in Christ.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A daring admission to make in these hateful, secular times. But I doubt he will come under too much fire, as long as he doesn’t use his new-found faith to justify <a href="http://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/contest-government-almighty-judge-soul/" title="&quot;A Contest Over Whether Your Government or the Almighty is the Judge of Your Soul&quot;">vicious attacks on the rights of others</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I close, I exhort you all to not intertwine or falsely associate our faith with politics, as easy as it might be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Too late.</p>
<p>Mr Jeffrey Robin ends his tenure at the <em>Nexus</em> fittingly, with a quote that he doesn’t seem to really understand:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man”</em> — Thomas Jefferson</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tyranny that Jefferson speaks of here is <a href="http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=JefLett.sgm&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=133&amp;division=div1" title="Letter to To Dr. Benjamin Rush, Sep. 23, 1800">that of organized Christianity</a>, were it allowed to be established as a state religion. But if Jeffrey realized this—that the hero he quotes is arguing <em>against</em> the sort of thing that would allow Christian institutions to <a href="http://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/contest-government-almighty-judge-soul/" title="&quot;A Contest Over Whether Your Government or the Almighty is the Judge of Your Soul&quot;">deny women basic reproductive rights</a>—then he would not be our beloved Mr Robin.</p>
<p>We will miss him <em>very</em> much.</p>

<h2>Mark Strong Didn’t Give a Shit Before It Was Cool To Not Give a Shit</h2>
</header>
<p>Mark Strong is just about the luckiest person in the world. Not only is he white, male and (presumably) straight and cis, he also has a column in the finest student newspaper at UCSB that isn’t <em>The Bottom Line</em> or <em>The Daily Nonsense</em>. And if that weren’t enough, <a href="http://dailynexus.com/2013-05-23/when-becoming-the-issue-becomes-the-issue/" title="When Becoming the Issue Becomes the Issue">ideas for his columns simply fall into his lap wherever he goes!</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was digging into a new novel on the patio outside Nicoletti’s a few weeks back when a single word in a nearby conversation caught my attention: divestment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The pair—a guy and girl, both college-aged and bespectacled, sipping coffee and picking at muffins—was sitting directly behind me. Not one to eavesdrop, I tried to find my place on the page in front of me, but before I could, I heard the word again. Divestment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Muffins, coffee, and spectacles? Hipsters, surely!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I can’t believe they took it off the table again,” the girl was saying.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I know,” the guy said. “I’m personally offended. It just goes to show how the ignorance in the …”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Words kept coming out of his mouth after that, but I found myself suddenly engrossed and mulling over that two-word phrase. Personally offended? Offended … personally? What the fuck does that even mean?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lest you thought that Mark Strong’s success in life is only the result of the incredible privilege he was born with, here he demonstrates that hard work has also played a part. Ben Moss needs at least <a href="sexy.html" title="Stop Making Sense (feat. Ben Moss)">450 words of clickbait</a> to inspire his articles, but Mark Strong can get by with just two <a href="http://infotrope.net/2009/08/05/action-and-reaction-on-avoiding-offense/" title="Action and reaction: on avoiding &quot;offense&quot;">poorly-chosen</a> words from a hipster. “Personally offended? Offended … personally?” He plays around with them, rolling them over his tongue, and through some alchemical process, a column emerges. Compare his thought process to Tom Friedman’s, and it becomes clear that <a href="http://buffalobeast.com/73/feature4.htm" title="The Word is Hack: The Impossible Physics of Thomas Friedman&#39;s Brain">they are related by something more than blood</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I left the Infosys campus that evening along the road back to Bangalore, I kept chewing on that phrase: “The playing field is being leveled.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What Nandan is saying, I thought, is that the playing field is being flattened … Flattened? Flattened? My God, he’s telling me the world is flat!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(What the <em>fuck</em> does that even mean?)</p>
<p>After wondering for some time what it could possibly mean to be personally offended (he having been lucky enough to avoid that feeling), Mark Strong asks the question that has largely defined his life:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When did we start taking things so goddamn personally?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mark Strong yearns for the days when lucky men like him could <em>rationally</em> debate the issues of the day without having to suffer the emotional outbursts of those personally affected. These hysterical children should be ignored, for “in personalizing the issue, [they] eradicate [their] ability to think of it objectively.”</p>
<p>Happily for Mark Strong, he doesn’t really care very much about Palestine, abortion, and other vitally important issues (in this way, he’s something of a hipster himself). They’re interesting things to play Devil’s advocate with, but ultimately (luckily!) they don’t affect Mark Strong’s life, so why would anyone get worked up about them? Just <em>let it go</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I finished chapter seven and stowed Stephen King’s <em>Misery</em> in the front pocket of my backpack, leaving the pair to bicker in peace on the patio in the bright May sunshine.</p>

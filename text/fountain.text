[Codeless Language Modules](http://www.barebones.com/support/develop/clm.html
"Documentation from Bare Bones Software") (CLMs) are plugins for
[TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/TextWrangler/
"TextWrangler product page on Bare Bones Software") and
[BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/ "BBEdit product
page on Bare Bones Software") that add syntax highlighting, code
folding, and other capabilities for languages not natively supported
by these programs.

[Fountain](http://fountain.io/ "Fountain information page") is a
plain-text syntax for writing screenplays. (The
[Fountain syntax](http://fountain.io/syntax "Fountain syntax
reference") is similar to that of
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "Markdown
project page"), a general-purpose syntax.) Fountain files are designed
to be very readable, but they can be easily converted to other formats
(like PDF and FDX) using
[Fountain-compatible applications](http://fountain.io/apps "Fountain
apps").

The University of California, Santa Barbara has a Philosophy
department, and the Philosophy department has a website.  In my
capacity as graduate student/web aficionado, I rewrote the website
from the ground up, making it vastly more responsive and accessible.
It's not amazing (yet), but I did it all in less than 30 hours so hey.

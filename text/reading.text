Include two lines in the `<head>` of a plain HTML file---the kind

[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)-to-HTML
conversion tools---and gain nifty features like keyboard shortcuts,
section folding, and color scheme switching:

``` {.html}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://baruffio.com/read/stylesheets/style.css">
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://baruffio.com/read/js/scripts.js"></script>
```

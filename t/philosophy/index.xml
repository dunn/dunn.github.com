&lt;p&gt;Snape was wrong when he suggested that the Marauder&amp;rsquo;s Map is &amp;ldquo;plainly
full of Dark Magic,&amp;rdquo; but it really is a remarkably powerful artifact
and it&amp;rsquo;s not at all obvious how it works.  How does it know your name,
in order to label your dot as it tracks you throughout the castle?  To
figure that out, we&amp;rsquo;re going to have to start from the beginning, and
figure out what names even &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;, and how &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sonorous!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-marauder-s-map-and-how-does-it-work:fdc9a463c8e7c1f53b2885942aa7663f&#34;&gt;What is the Marauder&amp;rsquo;s Map and how does it work?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a map showing every detail of the Hogwarts castle and
 grounds. But the truly remarkable thing was the tiny ink dots
 moving around it, each labelled with a name in minuscule
 writing. Astounded, Harry bent over it. A labelled dot in the top
 left corner showed that Professor Dumbledore was pacing his study;
 the caretaker&amp;rsquo;s cat, Mrs Norris, was prowling the second floor, and
 Peeves the poltergeist was currently bouncing around the trophy
 room (&lt;em&gt;PoA&lt;/em&gt;, Chapter 10).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea here is pretty straightforward: the Marauder&amp;rsquo;s Map is a map
of Hogwarts that also reveals the location of everyone inside the
castle&amp;mdash;or at least, the locations of people and certain cats.  It
reveals your location by placing a dot on the section of the map that
corresponds to where you are in the castle, and by labeling that dot
with your name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the books, the Map has no problem figuring out everyone&amp;rsquo;s name and
labeling them correctly.  But how does it do that?  How does it know
our names?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to answer that question, we first need to settle a more basic
question about the relationship between words and the world.  This
question might seem silly, but there is actually a great deal of
controversy over the correct answer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the relationship between someone&amp;mdash;like Harry Potter&amp;mdash;and
their name&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo;?  (Or their &lt;em&gt;names&lt;/em&gt;, if, like Alastor
Moody, they sometimes go by a different name.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we should start by making an assumption that&amp;rsquo;s common among
philosophers of language, which is that names &lt;em&gt;designate&lt;/em&gt;. In other
words, names (at least most of them) stand in a particular relation to
things in the world.  It&amp;rsquo;s because of this designation relation that
names &lt;em&gt;hook onto the world&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might seem like an obvious assumption, but not everyone agrees.
Before moving on, let&amp;rsquo;s discuss an objection to this assumption, and
why we&amp;rsquo;re going to stick with it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;some-people-don-t-think-names-designate:fdc9a463c8e7c1f53b2885942aa7663f&#34;&gt;Some people don&amp;rsquo;t think names designate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some philosophers, influenced by Ludwig Wittgenstein, have argued that
the answer we gave above, and the evocative metaphor of words hooking
onto the world, is altogether misguided.  The objection is that
instead of thinking of words as &lt;em&gt;labels&lt;/em&gt; that stick to various
objects, we should think of words, including names, as &lt;em&gt;tools&lt;/em&gt; that we
&lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; to do things.  On page 78 of his &lt;em&gt;Philosophy of Language: A
Contemporary Introduction&lt;/em&gt; (Second Edition), William Lycan suggests
that this is what Wittgenstein himself was getting at in his later
work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wittgenstein [offered] a further analogy
[in &lt;em&gt;Philosophical Investigations&lt;/em&gt;]: A builder and his assistant
have just four kinds of building stones that they use. They speak a
little primitive language that has just four corresponding words in
it: &amp;ldquo;block&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;pillar&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;slab&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;beam&amp;rdquo;. They build things,
engaging in their nonlinguistic activities aided by a certain
primitive sort of linguistic activity: the builder says &amp;ldquo;slab&amp;rdquo;, and
the assistant brings a stone of the appropriate shape. Now, someone
might say, &amp;ldquo;Of course, that word &amp;lsquo;slab&amp;rsquo; bears the [designation]
relation to a block of this shape, and its meaning is the
proposition that the assistant is to bring such a block to the
builder.&amp;rdquo; But according to Wittgenstein this would be missing the
point. In this little primitive language-game, the word &amp;ldquo;slab&amp;rdquo; does
have a function that is obviously connected with blocks of that
shape, but the point is the function and not the [designation]
relation. The point of the builder&amp;rsquo;s making the noise &amp;ldquo;slab&amp;rdquo; is just
to get the assistant to do something, to trigger conventionally (the
assistant having learned his trade) a pattern of useful
activity. The activity does involve things of this shape, but the
primary point is to initiate action, not to [designate].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea here, roughly, is that names, and words in general, are less
like &lt;em&gt;tags&lt;/em&gt; and more like &lt;em&gt;hammers&lt;/em&gt;. Instead of asking what a name is
&lt;em&gt;attached to&lt;/em&gt;, we should ask what a name is &lt;em&gt;used for&lt;/em&gt;. In
Wittgenstein&amp;rsquo;s example, the words &amp;ldquo;block&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;pillar&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;slab&amp;rdquo;, and
&amp;ldquo;beam&amp;rdquo; are used to make the assistant retrieve certain building
materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to this sort of theory, words in general work a lot like
spell-words do.  Here&amp;rsquo;s an example from &lt;em&gt;Chamber of Secrets&lt;/em&gt;, right
after Gilderoy Lockhart admits that he didn&amp;rsquo;t do any of the brave
things he claimed to do in his books:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He pulled out his wand and turned to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Awfully sorry, boys, but I&amp;rsquo;ll have to put a Memory Charm on you
now. Can&amp;rsquo;t have you blabbing my secrets all over the place.  I&amp;rsquo;d
never sell another book &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harry reached his wand just in time. Lockhart had barely raised his,
when Harry bellowed, &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Expelliarmus!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;CoS&lt;/em&gt;, Chapter 16)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to make much sense to ask what &amp;ldquo;Expelliarmus&amp;rdquo;
designated there.  It didn&amp;rsquo;t designate &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;.  It was &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; by
Harry to disarm Lockhart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;problems-with-the-words-as-tools-theory:fdc9a463c8e7c1f53b2885942aa7663f&#34;&gt;Problems with the words-as-tools theory&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As appealing as this words-as-tools theory is, it&amp;rsquo;s got some real
problems. Here&amp;rsquo;s one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look again at how we talked about the &amp;ldquo;Expelliarmus&amp;rdquo; case: we said
that &amp;ldquo;it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to make much sense to ask what &amp;lsquo;Expelliarmus&amp;rsquo;
designated &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;rdquo;  It &lt;em&gt;doesn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; seem to make much sense to ask what
&amp;ldquo;Expelliarmus&amp;rdquo; designated &lt;em&gt;in that context&lt;/em&gt;, but it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; make sense
to ask what &amp;ldquo;Expelliarmus&amp;rdquo; designates &lt;em&gt;in general&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, &amp;ldquo;Expelliarmus&amp;rdquo; designates &lt;em&gt;Expelliarmus&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;ldquo;Expelliarmus&amp;rdquo;
is the name of a spell.  When we use the word &amp;ldquo;Expelliarmus&amp;rdquo;, we&amp;rsquo;re
not always using it to cast a spell.  Sometimes we just want to talk
about the spell, like Harry and Zacharias Smith do during the first
meeting of Dumbledore&amp;rsquo;s Army:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Right,&amp;rdquo; said Harry, [&amp;hellip;] &amp;ldquo;shall we get practising then? I was
thinking, the first thing we should do is Expelliarmus, you know,
the Disarming Charm. I know it&amp;rsquo;s pretty basic but I&amp;rsquo;ve found it
really useful&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh, please,&amp;rdquo; said Zacharias Smith, rolling his eyes and folding his
arms. &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t think Expelliarmus is exactly going to help us
against You-Know-Who, do you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve used it against him,&amp;rdquo; said Harry quietly. &amp;ldquo;It saved my life in
June&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;OotP&lt;/em&gt;, Chapter 18).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the right conclusion to draw here is that, while
&amp;ldquo;Expelliarmus&amp;rdquo; designates &lt;em&gt;Expelliarmus&lt;/em&gt;, we don&amp;rsquo;t always &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Expelliarmus&amp;rdquo; to talk about &lt;em&gt;Expelliarmus&lt;/em&gt;.  Sometimes, as we&amp;rsquo;ve
seen, we use it to cast the spell.  Just because a word designates a
certain thing doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that we can&amp;rsquo;t use it to do things other
than talk about what it designates.  Malfoy does just this in
&lt;em&gt;Prisoner of Azkaban:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well, look who it is,&amp;rdquo; said Malfoy in his usual lazy drawl, pulling
open the compartment door. &amp;ldquo;Potty and the Weasel.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what &amp;ldquo;Potty&amp;rdquo; designates, but it&amp;rsquo;s not Harry.  And &amp;ldquo;the
Weasel&amp;rdquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t designate Ron&amp;mdash;many philosophers of language think
that the determiner &amp;ldquo;the&amp;rdquo; means that &amp;ldquo;the Weasel&amp;rdquo; can only designate
the &lt;em&gt;unique&lt;/em&gt; Weasel, and so doesn&amp;rsquo;t designate anything in a world with
many weasels, such the world of &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt;. But Malfoy is
nonetheless using &amp;ldquo;Potty&amp;rdquo; to talk about Harry and using &amp;ldquo;the Weasel&amp;rdquo;
to talk about Ron.  Let&amp;rsquo;s introduce another bit of technical language
and say that while &amp;ldquo;Potty&amp;rdquo; does not &lt;em&gt;designate&lt;/em&gt; Harry, Malfoy is using
it, in this context, to &lt;em&gt;refer&lt;/em&gt; to Harry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Context is important for &lt;em&gt;referring&lt;/em&gt;, but not for &lt;em&gt;designating&lt;/em&gt;.  If
&amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo; designates Harry Potter, it does so all the time, and
whether or not anyone is using the name.  But Malfoy has to be in the
right sort of situation in order to &lt;em&gt;refer&lt;/em&gt; to Harry using &amp;ldquo;Potty&amp;rdquo;.
Basically, he has to be in a situation where the people he&amp;rsquo;s talking
to realize he&amp;rsquo;s using &amp;ldquo;Potty&amp;rdquo; as if it was a name for Harry.  This is
how Kent Bach describes it on page 518 of &amp;ldquo;What Does it Take to
Refer?&amp;rdquo; in the &lt;em&gt;Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Language:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaker reference is a four-place relation between a speaker, an
expression, an audience, and a referent: you use an expression to
refer someone to something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between designation and reference will be important
later on, but the point of bringing it up now is to show that while
the words-as-tools theory is &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; to say that we use words for
different purposes in different contexts, that &lt;em&gt;doesn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; mean we
should think that words never designate anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other objections to the words-as-tools theory.  One is that
while it might be true for some words and maybe even some phrases,
it&amp;rsquo;s not &lt;em&gt;generally&lt;/em&gt; true; some words and phrases might be tools, but
some aren&amp;rsquo;t.  We&amp;rsquo;re interested in names right now, and names seem the
&lt;em&gt;least&lt;/em&gt; like tools; they really do seem more like labels or tags.
(And this objection could be pushed a little further: aren&amp;rsquo;t tags
ultimately a &lt;em&gt;sort of tool?&lt;/em&gt;  Even if all words &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; tools, does that
really rule out words that are meant to be used as tags?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another objection to words-as-tools is that even if I understand the
conventional ways to use English words, that&amp;rsquo;s not all there is to
&lt;em&gt;understanding&lt;/em&gt; English.  This is one of William Lycan&amp;rsquo;s objections,
from page 81 of &lt;em&gt;Philosophy of Language:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could I not know the use of an expression, and fall in with it,
mechanically, without understanding it? I have known undergraduates
who are geniuses at picking up academic jargon of one sort or
another and slinging it around with great facility, but without
understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(A similar example is in &lt;em&gt;Goblet of Fire&lt;/em&gt;, when Harry and Ron make up
predictions about what will happen to them instead of really doing
Divination, but aren&amp;rsquo;t caught by Professor Trelawny because they write
the sort of stuff she expects to hear.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could program a computer (or enchant a hat) to reply to English
sentences with other English sentences; it might be well-designed
enough to give replies that a fluent English speaker would give.  But
if the computer&amp;rsquo;s replies were chosen by making statistical
generalizations from a database of recorded conversations, we would
probably say that the computer doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; English.
It &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; use English words, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t know what they &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s more that could be said on both sides, but let&amp;rsquo;s put away the
words-as-tools theory, and accept for the time being that names really
do designate things.  Now let&amp;rsquo;s talk about &lt;em&gt;meaning&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-meaning-of-names:fdc9a463c8e7c1f53b2885942aa7663f&#34;&gt;The meaning of names&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far we&amp;rsquo;ve just talked about whether or not names designate things.
But at least for most words, you&amp;rsquo;re probably more familiar with the
question, &amp;ldquo;what does this word &lt;em&gt;mean?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;  We&amp;rsquo;re going to stay focused
just on names, so our question is &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;what do names mean?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have no problem explaining what most words mean, so it may seem odd
that the meaning of names is such a big problem.  For example, the
meaning of &amp;ldquo;squib&amp;rdquo; is &amp;ldquo;person without magical power but with at least
one parent who is a witch or wizard.&amp;rdquo;  The meaning of &amp;ldquo;thestral&amp;rdquo; is
something like &amp;ldquo;winged horse visible only to those who have seen and
understood death.&amp;rdquo;  But it&amp;rsquo;s not nearly as obvious what the meaning of
&amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo; is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re going to look at three different theories of names, which each
provide a different answer to the question, &amp;ldquo;what is the meaning of
&amp;lsquo;Harry Potter&amp;rsquo;?&amp;rdquo;  The first theory is &lt;strong&gt;Descriptivism&lt;/strong&gt;, the second is
&lt;strong&gt;Millianism&lt;/strong&gt;, and the third is &lt;strong&gt;Nominal Descriptivism&lt;/strong&gt;. I think
Nominal Descriptivism is the correct theory, and I&amp;rsquo;ll explain why, but
keep in mind that there are many philosophers who disagree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;descriptivism:fdc9a463c8e7c1f53b2885942aa7663f&#34;&gt;Descriptivism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As its name suggests, Descriptivism claims that the meaning of a name
is a &lt;em&gt;description&lt;/em&gt; of the person or object designated by that name.
According to this theory, names such as &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo; are a lot like
general terms like &amp;ldquo;squib&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;thestral&amp;rdquo;.  The meanings of those
words also describe the things they designate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the meaning of &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo; can&amp;rsquo;t be just any description that
describes Harry Potter.  For example, the meaning of &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo;
can&amp;rsquo;t be &amp;ldquo;the boy who lived&amp;rdquo;.  It&amp;rsquo;s true that &amp;ldquo;the boy who lived&amp;rdquo; is
commonly used to &lt;em&gt;refer&lt;/em&gt; to Harry Potter, and has become associated in
the popular imagination with Harry Potter, but &amp;ldquo;the boy who lived&amp;rdquo;
doesn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;uniquely&lt;/em&gt; describe Harry.  Strictly speaking, any living boy
is a boy who lived; Harry is not really unique in that respect.  And
as I mentioned above, &amp;ldquo;the&amp;rdquo; implies uniqueness.  There are many maps,
but only one Marauder&amp;rsquo;s Map, so it is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; Marauder&amp;rsquo;s Map.  If there
were multiple Marauder&amp;rsquo;s Maps, then it would not be correct to use
&amp;ldquo;the&amp;rdquo;.  &amp;ldquo;The Marauder&amp;rsquo;s Map&amp;rdquo; only designates the Marauder&amp;rsquo;s Map while
it is the unique&amp;mdash;the only&amp;mdash;Marauder&amp;rsquo;s Map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, &amp;ldquo;the boy who lived&amp;rdquo; does not designate Harry, even
though it is very often used to refer to him.  So if Descriptivism is
true, then the meaning of &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo; has to be something other
than &amp;ldquo;the boy who lived&amp;rdquo;.  It has to be something that uniquely
describes Harry, something like &amp;ldquo;the wizard born to James and Lily
Potter on 31 July 1980, who survived a Killing Curse cast by Voldemort
on Hallowe&amp;rsquo;en in 1981&amp;rdquo;.  &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; describes nobody else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Descriptivism, &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo; is really nothing more than
an &lt;em&gt;abbreviation&lt;/em&gt; of &amp;ldquo;the wizard born to James and Lily Potter on 31
July 1980, who survived a Killing Curse cast by Voldemort on
Hallowe&amp;rsquo;en in 1981&amp;rdquo;.  The only difference between the following two
sentences is their length:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wizard born to James and Lily Potter on 31 July 1980, who
survived a Killing Curse cast by Voldemort on Hallowe&amp;rsquo;en in 1981,
lives in the cupboard under the stairs of 4 Privet Drive, Little
Whinging, Surrey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harry Potter lives in the cupboard under the stairs of 4 Privet
Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Descriptivism is correct, then we use &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo; instead of
&amp;ldquo;the wizard born to James and Lily Potter on 31 July 1980, who
survived a Killing Curse cast by Voldemort on Hallowe&amp;rsquo;en in 1981&amp;rdquo; only
because it&amp;rsquo;s more convenient; the meaning is the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-would-the-map-work-in-a-descriptivist-world:fdc9a463c8e7c1f53b2885942aa7663f&#34;&gt;How would the Map work in a Descriptivist world?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s suppose that Descriptivism is correct.  What would that tell us
about how the Marauder&amp;rsquo;s Map works?  We&amp;rsquo;re not worried about how it
determines that &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; person is in, for example, the Gryffindor
common room; presumably that&amp;rsquo;s taken care of by the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://pottermore.wikia.com/wiki/Marauder%27s_Map&#34; title=&#34;entry for the Marauder&#39;s Map on the Pottermore wiki&#34;&gt;Homonculous Charm&lt;/a&gt;.  What we want
to know is how the Map goes further, and determines &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; that person
is.  Without asking anyone, how does it figure out your name?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s make some assumptions about Hogwarts in order to make this
easier.  We&amp;rsquo;ll suppose that the Map already has access to the names of
everyone who is in the castle.  If the Map didn&amp;rsquo;t have the names, then
it&amp;rsquo;s hard to see how the Map could match up people with their names.
It would have to be able to deduce a person&amp;rsquo;s name just from &amp;ldquo;looking&amp;rdquo;
at them; and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if that can be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why are we allowed to assume that the Map already has access to
the names of everyone in the castle?  I think we&amp;rsquo;re allowed to do so
for the following reason: Hogwarts is protected from intruders by a
number of enchantments.  One of these enchantments might well be an
enchantment that prevents unauthorized people from entering the
castle.  At the beginning of the year, the Headmaster or Headmistress
teaches Hogwarts the names of the new students, so that they may
enter.  Individuals who never attended the school but are either
permanent or temporary residents&amp;mdash;Peeves, Filch, Mrs. Norris, the
visitors from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang&amp;mdash;are added on a case-by-case
basis.  Hogwarts determines who is designated by each name, and allows
them entry.  The Marauder&amp;rsquo;s Map simply piggy-backs off this system of
enchantments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So: Hogwarts learns the name &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo;, and therefore the
Marauder&amp;rsquo;s Map does too.  How does the Map then take that name and
figure out who it designates?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Descriptivism is true, then what the Map learns when it learns the
name &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo; is that the meaning of &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo; is &amp;ldquo;the
wizard born to James and Lily Potter on 31 July 1980, who survived a
Killing Curse cast by Voldemort on Hallowe&amp;rsquo;en in 1981&amp;rdquo;.  So in order
to label Harry Potter&amp;rsquo;s dot on the Marauder&amp;rsquo;s Map, the Map just needs
to discover which of the people within Hogwarts is the wizard born to
James and Lily Potter on 31 July 1980, who survived a Killing Curse
cast by Voldemort on Hallowe&amp;rsquo;en in 1981.  Whoever in fact fits that
description is Harry Potter, according to this theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How the Map actually goes about this investigation is something
J.K. Rowling might have to tell us.  How the Map can reach back into
the past and figure out with complete certainty which of these people
&lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; in the castle was &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; the wizard who survived a Killing Curse
is a complicated question.  It&amp;rsquo;s also a question that we&amp;rsquo;re not going
to try to answer.  We now know &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; the Map needs to do in order to
label its dots, if Descriptivism is true.  &lt;em&gt;How&lt;/em&gt; it does that is a
question for another day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it might not even be worth trying to answer this second question,
because Descriptivism is probably not the correct theory anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;problems-with-descriptivism:fdc9a463c8e7c1f53b2885942aa7663f&#34;&gt;Problems with Descriptivism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Descriptivism is intuitive and straightforward, but it has some big
problems.  Here are two:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo; just means &amp;ldquo;the wizard born to James and Lily
Potter on 31 July 1980, who survived a Killing Curse cast by
Voldemort on Hallowe&amp;rsquo;en in 1981&amp;rdquo;, than anyone who understands the
name &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo; thereby &lt;em&gt;knows&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;just on the basis of
understanding the name!&amp;mdash;that Harry Potter survived a Killing
Curse cast by Voldemort.  But surely this isn&amp;rsquo;t right: we only
know that Harry survived Voldemort&amp;rsquo;s Killing Curse because we have
historical evidence about what happened that Hallowe&amp;rsquo;en.  It&amp;rsquo;s not
something we can learn simply by knowing what &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo;
means.  And if Harry&amp;rsquo;s name alone told us that he was born on 31
July 1980, then this could not have happened in &lt;em&gt;The Goblet of
Fire&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harry looked around; the whole class was staring at him. He sat
up straight; he had been almost dozing off, lost in the heat and
his thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I was saying, my dear, that you were clearly born under the
baleful influence of Saturn,&amp;rdquo; said Professor Trelawney, a faint
note of resentment in her voice at the fact that he had
obviously not been hanging on her words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Born under&amp;mdash;what, sorry?&amp;rdquo; said Harry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Saturn, dear, the planet Saturn!&amp;rdquo; said Professor Trelawney,
sounding definitely irritated that he wasn&amp;rsquo;t riveted by this
news. &amp;ldquo;I was saying that Saturn was surely in a position of
power in the heavens at the moment of your birth &amp;hellip; your dark
hair &amp;hellip; your mean stature &amp;hellip; tragic losses so young in life
&amp;hellip; I think I am right in saying, my dear, that you were born in
mid-winter?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No,&amp;rdquo; said Harry, &amp;ldquo;I was born in July&amp;rdquo; (Chapter 13).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems perfectly true to say &amp;ldquo;It could have been that Harry
Potter did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; survive that Killing Curse cast by Voldemort.&amp;rdquo;
If Lily hadn&amp;rsquo;t died trying to save him, her love wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have
protected him from Voldemort&amp;rsquo;s curse, and he would also have died.
But if Descriptivism is true, then the following are equivalent:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It could have been that Harry Potter did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; survive that
Killing Curse cast by Voldemort.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It could have been that the wizard born to James and Lily Potter
on 31 July 1980, who survived a Killing Curse cast by Voldemort on
Hallowe&amp;rsquo;en in 1981 did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; survive that Killing Curse cast by
Voldemort.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while the first is true, the second seems false.  How could it
be that the wizard, whoever it is, who survived a Killing Curse
&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have survived that Killing Curse?  We seem to be
contradicting ourselves.  But we are definitely &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;
contradicting ourselves by saying that Harry Potter might not have
survived that Killing Curse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, I think that Descriptivism cannot be the correct
theory of names.  So we should move on to examine Millianism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;millianism:fdc9a463c8e7c1f53b2885942aa7663f&#34;&gt;Millianism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two problems for Descriptivism that I listed above were originally
presented by Saul Kripke in a series of lectures at Princeton in 1972.
Descriptivism was much more widely accepted then than it is now, and
it was Kripke&amp;rsquo;s lectures that caused philosophers to abandon
Descriptivism and look for a better theory of names.  Many settled on
Millianism, which is called that because it was inspired by the
philosophy of John Stuart Mill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Millianism, the meaning of a name &lt;em&gt;just is&lt;/em&gt; the
designation of the name.  The meaning of &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo; is nothing
more than the person designated by that name&amp;mdash;Harry Potter, the
wizard himself.  Compare this with Descriptivism: according to that
theory, &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo; designates Harry Potter because the meaning of
the name&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;the wizard born to James and Lily Potter on 31 July 1980,
who survived a Killing Curse cast by Voldemort on Hallowe&amp;rsquo;en in
1981&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;uniquely describes Harry Potter.  According to Millianism,
&amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo; designates Harry Potter because the meaning of the name
just &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; Harry Potter.  The meaning of &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t something
that describes or &lt;em&gt;picks out&lt;/em&gt; that wizard; the meaning &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; that
wizard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This theory does not face the two problems that face Descriptivism:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo; does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; mean &amp;ldquo;the wizard born to James and
Lily Potter on 31 July 1980, who survived a Killing Curse cast by
Voldemort on Hallowe&amp;rsquo;en in 1981&amp;rdquo;, then understanding the name
&amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo; not &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; require knowing that Harry Potter
survived a Killing Curse cast by Voldemort, or knowing when Harry
was born.  Understanding the name just requires knowing who it
designates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Millianism is true, then the following are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; equivalent:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It could have been that Harry Potter did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; survive that
Killing Curse cast by Voldemort.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It could have been that the wizard born to James and Lily Potter
on 31 July 1980, who survived a Killing Curse cast by Voldemort on
Hallowe&amp;rsquo;en in 1981 did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; survive that Killing Curse cast by
Voldemort.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there is nothing strange about denying the second while
agreeing with the first, if Millianism is correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while Millianism avoids the problems that plagued Descriptivism,
it faces its own set of challenges, as we&amp;rsquo;ll see.  But first let&amp;rsquo;s
look at how the Marauder&amp;rsquo;s Map would function &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; Millianism were
true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-would-the-map-work-in-a-millian-world:fdc9a463c8e7c1f53b2885942aa7663f&#34;&gt;How would the Map work in a Millian world?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Millianism is true, what the Marauder&amp;rsquo;s Map has to do in order to
label its dots is actually very little.  Since the meaning of a name,
according to Millianism, just is the thing designated by that name,
when the Map learns the name &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo;, what it learns is &lt;em&gt;who
&amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo; designates&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So just learning &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo; gives the Map everything it needs to
pinpoint and label Harry Potter.  Descriptivism gave the Map only a
description of Harry Potter; Millianism gives the Map Harry Potter
himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is great, because we don&amp;rsquo;t have to ask Rowling how the Map can
investigate who fits the descriptions associated with names.  But
unfortunately, Millianism has serious problems that make it a less
attractive theory than you might think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;problems-with-millianism:fdc9a463c8e7c1f53b2885942aa7663f&#34;&gt;Problems with Millianism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plenty of people have multiple names.  Alastor Moody is more often
known as &amp;ldquo;Mad-Eye Moody&amp;rdquo;.  If, like Millianism says, the meaning
of &amp;ldquo;Alastor Moody&amp;rdquo; and the meaning of &amp;ldquo;Mad-Eye Moody&amp;rdquo; are both
just the ex-Auror, then they should be completely
&lt;em&gt;interchangeable&lt;/em&gt;. But they&amp;rsquo;re not, because we often don&amp;rsquo;t realize
that two names designate the same person:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There are those who&amp;rsquo;ll turn innocent occasions to their
advantage,&amp;rdquo; Moody retorted in a menacing voice. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s my job to
think the way Dark wizards do, Karkaroff&amp;mdash;as you ought to
remember &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Alastor!&amp;rdquo; said Dumbledore warningly.  Harry wondered for a
moment whom he was speaking to, but then realised &amp;ldquo;Mad-Eye&amp;rdquo;
could hardly be Moody&amp;rsquo;s real first name (&lt;em&gt;GoF&lt;/em&gt;, Chapter 17).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if Millianism was true, then &amp;ldquo;Alastor Moody is Mad-Eye Moody&amp;rdquo;
is &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt; true, because the two names are perfect synonyms.
If Millianism was true, then nobody would &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; disagree with
&amp;ldquo;Alastor Moody is the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at
Hogwarts&amp;rdquo; while agreeing with &amp;ldquo;Mad-Eye Moody is the Defense
Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts.&amp;rdquo;  But before Harry&amp;rsquo;s
name came out of the Goblet of Fire, he would have done just that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the meaning of &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo; is just Harry Potter, then if Harry
Potter &lt;em&gt;doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist&lt;/em&gt;, the name is meaningless!  If the only
meaning it has is the person it designates, then there&amp;rsquo;s no
meaning if there&amp;rsquo;s no person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Harry Potter is alive, while he &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; exist, &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter
doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist&amp;rdquo; is a perfectly meaningful sentence&amp;mdash;except that
it&amp;rsquo;s false.  But when Harry ceases to exist, there is no longer
anything for &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo; to designate, so &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter doesn&amp;rsquo;t
exist&amp;rdquo; is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; meaningful, because &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo; has quite
literally lost its meaning.  Just when we would want to say that
Harry Potter doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist, it seems that we no longer can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These objections are convincing enough for me to think that Millianism
cannot be the correct theory of names either.  Fortunately we have one
more candidate that is better than either Descriptivism or Millianism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;nominal-descriptivism:fdc9a463c8e7c1f53b2885942aa7663f&#34;&gt;Nominal Descriptivism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theory of Nominal Descriptivism was given that name by Kent Bach.
The name makes perfect sense, because this is what the theory says:
the meaning of any name &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; is &amp;ldquo;the thing designated by &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo;
(Since we&amp;rsquo;ve been talking about names of people, from now on we&amp;rsquo;ll say
“the &lt;em&gt;person&lt;/em&gt; designated by &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;.”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, Nominal Descriptivism says that the meaning of &amp;ldquo;Harry
Potter&amp;rdquo; is &amp;ldquo;the person designated by &amp;lsquo;Harry Potter&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo;  According to
this theory, the following differ only in length:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person designated by &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo; lives in the cupboard under
the stairs of 4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harry Potter lives in the cupboard under the stairs of 4 Privet
Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This simple theory avoids the problems that plagued &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; (regular)
Descriptivism and Millianism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-nominal-descriptivism-avoids-the-descriptivist-problems:fdc9a463c8e7c1f53b2885942aa7663f&#34;&gt;How Nominal Descriptivism avoids the Descriptivist problems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Descriptivism had the bizarre consequence that it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;true by
definition&lt;/em&gt; that Harry Potter survived a Killing Curse.  This
meant that anyone who understands the name &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo; thereby
knows that Harry survived a Killing Curse, just like anyone who
understands the word &amp;ldquo;squib&amp;rdquo; knows that squibs don&amp;rsquo;t have magical
power.  All &lt;em&gt;Nominal Descriptivism&lt;/em&gt; says is that anyone who
understands &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo; thereby knows that Harry Potter is
designated by &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo;.  That&amp;rsquo;s not a bizarre consequence at
all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Descriptivism was forced to deny that Harry Potter might not have
survived the Killing Curse cast by Voldemort, because part of the
&lt;em&gt;meaning&lt;/em&gt; of &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo; was &amp;ldquo;the wizard who survived a Killing
Curse cast by Voldemort&amp;rdquo;.  As it turns out, Nominal Descriptivism
denies this too, but for a very different reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nominal Descriptivism says that the meaning of &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo; is
&amp;ldquo;the person designated by &amp;lsquo;Harry Potter&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo;  That is a &lt;em&gt;definite&lt;/em&gt;
description, and we saw above that definite descriptions&amp;mdash;like
&amp;ldquo;the wizard born to James and Lily Potter on 31 July 1980, who
survived a Killing Curse cast by Voldemort on Hallowe&amp;rsquo;en in
1981&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;are supposed to &lt;em&gt;uniquely&lt;/em&gt; designate someone.  This means
that the sentence &amp;ldquo;the person designated by &amp;lsquo;Harry Potter&amp;rsquo; lives
in the cupboard under the stairs of 4 Privet Drive, Little
Whinging, Surrey&amp;rdquo; is only true, strictly speaking, if there is
just &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; person designated by &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo;.  If there is more
than one person in the world named &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo;, then it&amp;rsquo;s not
&lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; true that &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; person designated by &amp;lsquo;Harry Potter&amp;rsquo;
lives in the cupboard under the stairs of 4 Privet Drive, Little
Whinging, Surrey.  And if Nominal Descriptivism is true, then it&amp;rsquo;s
likewise &lt;em&gt;false&lt;/em&gt; that Harry Potter lives in the cupboard under the
stairs of 4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, pretty much everything said using the name &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo;
will be literally false if there is more than one person named
&amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo;.  But this is not as bad as it seems!  A lot of
what we say is literally false, even though we don&amp;rsquo;t realize it:
suppose there&amp;rsquo;s a party in Gryffindor Tower and Fred says &amp;ldquo;there&amp;rsquo;s
no butterbeer.&amp;rdquo;  He&amp;rsquo;s actually saying something false because he&amp;rsquo;s
denying that there&amp;rsquo;s butterbeer, &lt;em&gt;period&lt;/em&gt;.  And surely there&amp;rsquo;s
butterbeer &lt;em&gt;somewhere;&lt;/em&gt; in the Hogwarts kitchens, in the Three
Broomsticks, and so on.  But &lt;em&gt;what Fred meant&lt;/em&gt; is that there&amp;rsquo;s no
butterbeer in Gryffindor Tower.  For the same reason, if Harry
says &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m Harry Potter,&amp;rdquo; he&amp;rsquo;s technically uttering a falsehood,
but as long as the people he&amp;rsquo;s talking to understand that he&amp;rsquo;s
referring them to himself (remember that &lt;em&gt;reference&lt;/em&gt; is a
four-place relation between a speaker, audience, name and object),
everyone knows what he means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s for this reason that &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter might not have survived
that Killing Curse cast by Voldemort&amp;rdquo; is literally false; there
are almost certainly multiple people named &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo;.  But
depending on who the speaker intends to &lt;em&gt;refer&lt;/em&gt; to when they say
that Harry Potter might not have survived that Killing Curse cast
by Voldemort, what they &lt;em&gt;meant&lt;/em&gt; (“&lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; might not have survived”)
may be true or false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If you still think that this is a big problem for Nominal
Descriptivism, keep in mind that we never discussed how regular
Descriptivism and Millianism deal with multiple people sharing a
name.  If there is even one other Harry Potter, then &amp;ldquo;Harry
Potter&amp;rdquo; can&amp;rsquo;t just mean &amp;ldquo;the wizard born to &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; (like
Descriptivism says), and it can&amp;rsquo;t mean &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; Harry Potter (like
Millianism says), because what about the other Harry Potter(s)?
These theories would have to be tweaked to cope with this
complication, and those tweaks may end up being just as
unintuitive.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-nominal-descriptivism-avoids-the-millian-problems:fdc9a463c8e7c1f53b2885942aa7663f&#34;&gt;How Nominal Descriptivism avoids the Millian problems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A big problem for Millianism was that it gave us the strange result
that there&amp;rsquo;s absolutely no difference between names that designate
the same person&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Mad-Eye Moody&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Alastor Moody&amp;rdquo; should be
interchangeable everywhere.  But if Nominal Descriptivism is
correct, then &amp;ldquo;Mad-Eye Moody&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;the person designated by
&amp;lsquo;Mad-Eye Moody&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Alastor Moody&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;the person designated
by &amp;lsquo;Alastor Moody&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo;  Now the names are no longer synonymous, and
there is no mystery as to how Harry could fail to realize that
Mad-Eye Moody is Alastor Moody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millianism also seemed unable to make sense of statements like
&amp;ldquo;Harry Potter does not exist.&amp;rdquo;  Nominal Descriptivism has no
problem with these &lt;em&gt;negative existentials:&lt;/em&gt; if Harry Potter means
&amp;ldquo;the person designated by &amp;lsquo;Harry Potter&amp;rsquo;,&amp;rdquo; then everything becomes
clear: we are just denying that anyone is designated by &amp;ldquo;Harry
Potter&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-does-the-map-work-in-a-nominal-descriptivist-world:fdc9a463c8e7c1f53b2885942aa7663f&#34;&gt;How does the Map work in a Nominal Descriptivist world?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be a bit complicated.  Remember that in a (regular)
Descriptivist world, when the map learns &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo;, it learns
that Harry Potter is the wizard, whoever it is, who was born to James
and Lily Potter on 31 July 1980, and who survived a Killing Curse cast
by Voldemort on Hallowe&amp;rsquo;en in 1981.  In a Millian world, the Map
simply learns who Harry Potter is.  But in our Nominal Descriptivist
world, all the Map can learn is that the name &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo;
designates whoever it in fact designates.  Not very helpful at all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Nominal Descriptivist world, unlike the previous worlds we
examined, learning the meaning of a name does not give you enough
information to determine who is designated by that name.  So the Map
will have to look elsewhere for information about who&amp;rsquo;s designated by
what names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where will we look next?  We&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to figure out a &lt;em&gt;semantic&lt;/em&gt;
fact: what individual(s) are designated by &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo;.  Previously
we were able to figure this out using another semantic fact&amp;mdash;the
meaning of &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo;.  But now that semantic fact has failed us.
So we will have to look at &lt;em&gt;metasemantic&lt;/em&gt; facts: in particular, the
facts about &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo; designates the individuals it does.
How did it come to be that Harry Potter (&lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; Harry Potter; the
wizard, the hero of our stories) came to be designated by &amp;ldquo;Harry
Potter&amp;rdquo;?  How did he get his name?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;semantic-and-metasemantic-facts:fdc9a463c8e7c1f53b2885942aa7663f&#34;&gt;Semantic and metasemantic facts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned above that Saul Kripke argued against Descriptivism in a
series of lectures, later published as &lt;em&gt;Naming and Necessity&lt;/em&gt;. An
important feature of his argument is that while he insists that the
meaning of a proper name like &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo; cannot be some definite
description like &amp;ldquo;the wizard who was born to James and Lily Potter on
31 July 1980 and survived a Killing Curse cast by Voldemort on
Hallowe&amp;rsquo;en in 1981&amp;rdquo;, he admits (on pages 57&amp;ndash;58) that a description
like that &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be used to &lt;em&gt;fix the designation&lt;/em&gt; of &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems plausible to suppose that, in some cases, the [designation]
of a name is indeed fixed &lt;em&gt;via&lt;/em&gt; a description in the same way that
the metric system was fixed. When [someone] first saw
Hesperus, he may well have fixed [the designation] by saying, &amp;ldquo;I shall
use &amp;lsquo;Hesperus&amp;rsquo; as a name of the heavenly body appearing in yonder
position in the sky.&amp;rdquo; He then fixed the [designation] of &amp;ldquo;Hesperus&amp;rdquo; by
its apparent celestial position.  Does it then follow that it is a
part of the &lt;em&gt;meaning&lt;/em&gt; of the name that Hesperus has such and such a
position at the time in question?  Surely not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is that there are multiple ways to name something or someone.
Let&amp;rsquo;s imagine Lily Potter naming her baby.  There are at least two
different ways she could do it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;She could say &amp;ldquo;let &amp;lsquo;Harry Potter&amp;rsquo; designate the wizard, whoever it
is, who was born to James and Lily Potter on 31 July 1980, and who
survived a Killing Curse cast by Voldemort on Hallowe&amp;rsquo;en in 1981&amp;rdquo;
(of course, unless she is a Seer, she would not have used that exact
description).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;She can point at the baby and say &amp;ldquo;let &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; child be named &amp;lsquo;Harry
Potter&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important point here is that when Lily says these things, she is
fixing the designation of &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo;, but she is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; giving a
&lt;em&gt;definition&lt;/em&gt; of &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo;.  We&amp;rsquo;ve already seen why &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo;
cannot be defined as meaning &amp;ldquo;the wizard who was born to James and
Lily Potter on 31 July 1980 and survived a Killing Curse cast by
Voldemort on Hallowe&amp;rsquo;en in 1981&amp;rdquo;, or as meaning the person himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that Lily fixed the designation of &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo; by, let&amp;rsquo;s
say, pointing and saying &amp;ldquo;that child shall be &amp;lsquo;Harry Potter&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; is
therefore &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a semantic fact.  It&amp;rsquo;s not a fact that can be
expressed as &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Harry Potter&amp;rsquo; means such-and-such&amp;rdquo;, nor can it be
expressed as &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Harry Potter&amp;rsquo; designates the so-and-so.&amp;rdquo;  It&amp;rsquo;s a
&lt;em&gt;metasemantic&lt;/em&gt; fact that tells us &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; the semantic facts.  Knowing
this metasemantic fact, we can then use it to figure out the semantic
fact that &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo; designates the baby that Lily Potter pointed
at when she said &amp;ldquo;that child shall be &amp;lsquo;Harry Potter&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo;  It&amp;rsquo;s this
semantic question&amp;mdash;who is designated by &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo;?&amp;mdash;that the
Map needs to answer, in order to label Harry when he arrives at
Hogwarts.  But it won&amp;rsquo;t be able to answer that question without first
learning some metasemantic facts about how Harry got his name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We face again the question of how the Map reaches back into the past.
How can it know for certain when and how a person was named, so that
it can learn what name they were given?  I&amp;rsquo;m afraid this is a question
for another day.  We now know &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; the Map needs to know.  I won&amp;rsquo;t
here try to answer &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; it might come to know it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here at &lt;em&gt;Baruffio&lt;/em&gt; we sometimes cast a critical eye on &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter,&lt;/em&gt;
and amuse ourselves by pointing out inconsistencies in the books (then
&lt;a href=&#34;http://baruffio.com/p/trace&#34; title=&#34;There&#39;s no Such
Thing as the Trace&#34;&gt;weaving them into conspiracy theories&lt;/a&gt;).  But time travel in &lt;em&gt;Prisoner of Azkaban&lt;/em&gt; is a
model of consistency, illustrating wonderfully how time travel
works&amp;mdash;if it&amp;rsquo;s possible at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;going-back:eefdcd66b28c2b86ef84bba398f2d59a&#34;&gt;Going back&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Chapter 21 of &lt;em&gt;Prisoner of Azkaban,&lt;/em&gt; Harry and Hermione wake up in
the hospital wing to learn that Sirius Black is about to receive the
Dementor&amp;rsquo;s Kiss.  It is, as Dumbledore tells them, too late to save
him:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sirius has not acted like an innocent man. The attack on the Fat
Lady&amp;mdash;entering Gryffindor Tower with a knife&amp;mdash;without Pettigrew,
alive or dead, we have no chance of overturning Sirius&amp;rsquo; sentence.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;But you believe us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes, I do,&amp;rdquo; said Dumbledore quietly. &amp;ldquo;But I have no power to make
other men see the truth, or to overrule the Minister for Magic &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harry stared up into the grave face and felt as though the ground
beneath him was falling sharply away.  He had grown used to the idea
that Dumbledore could solve anything.  He had expected Dumbledore to
pull some amazing solution out of the air.  But no &amp;hellip; their last
hope was gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What we need,&amp;rdquo; said Dumbledore slowly, and his light-blue eyes
moved from Harry to Hermione, &amp;ldquo;is more &lt;em&gt;time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo; Hermione began. And then her eyes became very round. &amp;ldquo;OH!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now, pay attention,&amp;rdquo; said Dumbledore, speaking very low, and very
clearly.  &amp;ldquo;Sirius is locked in Professor Flitwick&amp;rsquo;s office on the
seventh floor.  Thirteenth window from the right of the West Tower.
If all goes well, you will be able to save more than one innocent
life tonight.  But remember this, both of you. &lt;em&gt;You must not be
seen.&lt;/em&gt; Miss Granger, you know the law&amp;mdash;you know what is at stake
&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;you&amp;mdash;must&amp;mdash;not&amp;mdash;be&amp;mdash;seen”&lt;/em&gt; (Chapter 21).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so they go back in time, to rescue Buckbeak the Hippogriff and
Sirius Black.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;you-must-not-be-seen-and-you-will-not-be-seen:eefdcd66b28c2b86ef84bba398f2d59a&#34;&gt;You must not be seen, and you &lt;em&gt;will not&lt;/em&gt; be seen&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harry and Hermione go back in time with the intention of preventing
Buckbeak from being killed.  But it&amp;rsquo;s very important to realize that
&lt;em&gt;Buckbeak never was killed.&lt;/em&gt;  When Hermione spins the Time-Turner to
send her and Harry back three hours, Buckbeak isn&amp;rsquo;t dead.  They&amp;rsquo;d
already saved him!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to make this clear because Rowling leaves Buckbeak&amp;rsquo;s
fate deliberately ambiguous the first time around, in Chapter 16
and 17.  When Hermione, Harry, Ron, and Scabbers leave Hagrid&amp;rsquo;s hut at
sundown, they &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; they hear Buckbeak being killed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rat was squealing wildly, but not loudly enough to cover up the
sounds drifting from Hagrid&amp;rsquo;s garden. There was a jumble of
indistinct male voices, a silence and then, without warning, the
unmistakeable swish and thud of an axe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hermione swayed on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;They did it!&amp;rdquo; she whispered to Harry. &amp;ldquo;I d-don&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;mdash;they
did it!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harry&amp;rsquo;s mind had gone blank with shock. The three of them stood
transfixed with horror under the Invisibility Cloak. The very last
rays of the setting sun were casting a bloody light over the
long-shadowed grounds. Then, behind them, they heard a wild howling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hagrid,&amp;rdquo; Harry muttered. Without thinking about what he was doing,
he made to turn back, but both Ron and Hermione seized his arms
(Chapters 16&amp;ndash;17).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they&amp;rsquo;re leaving the cabin, they don&amp;rsquo;t see Buckbeak getting killed.
They hear Hagrid howling, but they can&amp;rsquo;t hear it clearly.  This is
because Buckbeak &lt;em&gt;didn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; get killed, and Hagrid is howling from joy,
not from grief.  When Harry and Hermione go back in time, the first
thing they do is rescue Buckbeak.  While Hagrid, Dumbledore, a
Ministry committee member, and the executioner Macnair are in Hagrid&amp;rsquo;s
hut, Harry unties Buckbeak and leads him away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hagrid&amp;rsquo;s back door had opened with a bang. Harry, Hermione and
Buckbeak stood quite still; even the Hippogriff seemed to be
listening intently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silence &amp;hellip; then&amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Where is it?&amp;rdquo; said the reedy voice of the Committee member. &amp;ldquo;Where
is the beast?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It was tied here!&amp;rdquo; said the executioner furiously. &amp;ldquo;I saw it! Just
here!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;How extraordinary,&amp;rdquo; said Dumbledore. There was a note of amusement
in his voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Beaky!&amp;rdquo; said Hagrid huskily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a swishing noise, and the thud of an axe. The executioner
seemed to have swung it into the fence in anger. And then came the
howling, and &lt;strong&gt;this time they could hear Hagrid&amp;rsquo;s words through his
sobs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Gone! Gone! Bless his little beak, he&amp;rsquo;s gone! Musta pulled himself
free! Beaky, yeh clever boy!&amp;rdquo; (Chapter 21, my emphasis)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve emphasized the important clause above.  It was never true that
Buckbeak got executed.  Hagrid is sobbing with joy &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; times we see
this scene.  When Harry and Hermione are under the Invisibility Cloak
with Ron and Scabbers, they &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; they are listening to Macnair
killing the Hippogriff, but they are &lt;em&gt;wrong:&lt;/em&gt; Buckbeak had already
been rescued&amp;mdash;by them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harry doesn&amp;rsquo;t change the past when he casts his Patronus, either.
After he, Hermione, Ron, Sirius, Lupin, Snape, and Pettigrew leave the
Shrieking Shack, the full moon comes out and Lupin transforms into a
werewolf.  Pettigrew escapes in the confusion, and Sirius chases after
him.  Harry and Hermione find Sirius at the edge of the Hogwarts lake,
surrounded by Dementors.  Sirius and Hermione faint, and just before
Harry&amp;rsquo;s soul is sucked from his body by the Dementor&amp;rsquo;s Kiss, something
miraculous happens:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something was driving the Dementors back &amp;hellip; it was circling around
him and Sirius and Hermione &amp;hellip; the rattling, sucking sounds of the
Dementors were fading. They were leaving &amp;hellip; the air was warm again
&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With every ounce of strength he could muster, Harry raised his head
a few inches and saw an animal amidst the light, galloping away
across the lake. Eyes blurred with sweat, Harry tried to make out
what it was &amp;hellip; it was bright as a unicorn.  Fighting to stay
conscious, Harry watched it canter to a halt as it reached the
opposite shore.  For a moment, Harry saw, by its brightness,
somebody welcoming it back &amp;hellip; raising his hand to pat it
&amp;hellip; someone who looked strangely familiar &amp;hellip; but it couldn&amp;rsquo;t be
&amp;hellip; (Chapter 20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harry thinks he was saved by his father, but he&amp;rsquo;s wrong.  He saved
himself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harry raised his head to look at the circle of Dementors across the
lake.  One of them was lowering its hood.  It was time for the
rescuer to appear&amp;mdash;but no one was coming to help this time&amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then it hit him&amp;mdash;he understood. He hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen his father&amp;mdash;he
had seen &lt;em&gt;himself&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harry flung himself out from behind the bush and pulled out his
wand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;EXPECTO PATRONUM!&amp;rdquo; he yelled (Chapter 21).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Harry does this, he&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; changing the past.  The person who
cast the Patronus was him, all along:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Harry, I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;mdash;you conjured up a Patronus that drove
away all those Dementors! That&amp;rsquo;s very, &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; advanced magic &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I knew I could do it this time,&amp;rdquo; said Harry, &amp;ldquo;because I&amp;rsquo;d already
done it &amp;hellip; Does that make sense?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything Harry and Hermione do in Chapter 21 has already occurred
when Hermione spins the Time-Turner three times.  They don&amp;rsquo;t change
the past; everything they have to do, they have already done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why don&amp;rsquo;t they change the past &lt;em&gt;anyway?&lt;/em&gt; Harry wants to; he tries
to convince Hermione to capture Pettigrew while Pettigrew&amp;mdash;in the
form of Scabbers&amp;mdash;is still in Hagrid&amp;rsquo;s cabin with Harry and
Hermione&amp;rsquo;s past selves.  But Hermione won&amp;rsquo;t let him:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hermione,&amp;rdquo; said Harry suddenly, &amp;ldquo;what if we&amp;mdash;we just run in there,
and grab Pettigrew&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No!&amp;rdquo; said Hermione in a terrified whisper. &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t you understand?
We&amp;rsquo;re breaking one of the most important wizarding laws!  Nobody&amp;rsquo;s
supposed to change time, nobody! You heard Dumbledore, if we&amp;rsquo;re
seen&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;d only be seen by ourselves and Hagrid!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Harry, what do you think you&amp;rsquo;d do if you saw yourself bursting into
Hagrid&amp;rsquo;s house?&amp;rdquo; said Hermione.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;d&amp;mdash;I&amp;rsquo;d think I&amp;rsquo;d gone mad,&amp;rdquo; said Harry, &amp;ldquo;or I&amp;rsquo;d think there was
some Dark Magic going on&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Exactly!&lt;/em&gt; You wouldn&amp;rsquo;t understand, you might even attack yourself!
Don&amp;rsquo;t you see? Professor McGonagall told me what awful things have
happened when wizards have meddled with time &amp;hellip; loads of them ended
up killing their past or future selves by mistake!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason Hermione gives as to why they don&amp;rsquo;t change the past is that
it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;dangerous.&lt;/em&gt;  She seems to believe this herself, because she
thinks she and Harry &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; changing the past, and breaking the law in
doing so.  As far as she and Harry know, Buckbeak &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; executed, and
they&amp;rsquo;re trying to change that.  Because Hermione thinks they are
changing the past, and because she thinks it&amp;rsquo;s very dangerous, she
panics whenever Harry tries to change things without thinking about
the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hermione tells Harry not to change this part of the past because it&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;em&gt;dangerous.&lt;/em&gt; She thinks the past shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be changed except in very
rare circumstances, but she thinks it is possible to change the past.
Indeed, she and Harry think they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; going to change the past when
they rescue Buckbeak.  They don&amp;rsquo;t know that he was never killed; they
thinks he &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; killed, and they&amp;rsquo;re trying to change that.  Hermione
believes that while they&amp;rsquo;re taking a big risk in rescuing Buckbeak, it
would be an even bigger risk to burst into Hagrid&amp;rsquo;s cabin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But she needn&amp;rsquo;t have worried.  Not only is changing the past not
dangerous, it&amp;rsquo;s simply &lt;em&gt;impossible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-past-is-fixed:eefdcd66b28c2b86ef84bba398f2d59a&#34;&gt;The past is fixed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is it impossible to change the past?  Why is it impossible for
Harry to burst into Hagrid&amp;rsquo;s cabin and grab Scabbers?  Here&amp;rsquo;s a rough
way of explaining why it&amp;rsquo;s impossible:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harry, standing outside and wondering if he should burst into
Hagrid&amp;rsquo;s cabin, can remember sitting inside with Scabbers.  He can
also remember &lt;em&gt;leaving&lt;/em&gt; Hagrid&amp;rsquo;s cabin with Scabbers, and he
remembers nobody bursting in and trying to grab Scabbers.  His
memory is correct&amp;mdash;what he remembers happening is what happens, so
it&amp;rsquo;s too late to try to change it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This explanation should strike you as odd; who cares if he remembers
nobody bursting into Hagrid&amp;rsquo;s cabin?  Of course nobody has &lt;em&gt;yet,&lt;/em&gt; but
the question is whether he, Harry, &lt;em&gt;will.&lt;/em&gt; There&amp;rsquo;s nothing in the past
that rules out Harry bursting into Hagrid&amp;rsquo;s cabin, so why can&amp;rsquo;t he?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rough explanation &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; odd, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s actually more or
less right.  To see why, we need to take a detour and introduce some
new terms for talking about time: &amp;ldquo;external time&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;personal time.&amp;rdquo;
These terms were coined by David Lewis in his 1976 paper
&lt;a href=&#34;http://kieranhealy.org/files/misc/lewis-paradoxes.pdf&#34; title=&#34;PDF&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Paradoxes of Time Travel.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;  Lewis proposes that we think about time travel as involving &amp;ldquo;a
discrepancy between time and time&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any traveler departs and then arrives at his destination; the time
elapsed from departure to arrival (positive, or perhaps zero) is the
duration of the journey.  But if he is a time traveler, the
separation in time between departure and arrival does not equal the
duration of his journey.  He departs; he travels for an hour, let us
say; then he arrives.  The time he reaches is not the time one hour
after his departure.  It is later, if he has traveled toward the
future; earlier, if he has traveled toward the past.  If he has
traveled far toward the past, it is earlier even than his
departure.  How can it be that the same two events, his departure
and his arrival, are separated by two unequal amounts of time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer to this puzzle requires distinguishing &amp;ldquo;external time&amp;rdquo; from
&amp;ldquo;personal time.&amp;rdquo;  External time is what is recorded by clock-towers
and atomic clocks; when Harry and Hermione go back in time, they are
going three hours backward in &lt;em&gt;external time.&lt;/em&gt; But they are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;
going back in &lt;em&gt;personal time.&lt;/em&gt; Personal time is what is recorded by
Harry&amp;rsquo;s wristwatch.  If Harry checked his watch before and after
Hermione spins the Time-Turner, the hands would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have moved three
hours back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When David Lewis says that time travel involves a discrepancy between
&amp;ldquo;time and time,&amp;rdquo; he means that there is a discrepancy between external
time and personal time; the two come apart:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The time traveler&amp;rsquo;s] journey takes an hour of his personal time,
let us say; his wristwatch reads an hour later at arrival than at
departure.  But the arrival is more than an hour after the departure
in external time, if he travels toward the future; or the arrival is
before the departure in external time (or less than an hour after),
if he travels toward the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end of Harry and Hermione&amp;rsquo;s journey&amp;mdash;when they appear in the
Entrance Hall&amp;mdash;is a few seconds &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt;, in &lt;em&gt;personal&lt;/em&gt; time, the
beginning of their journey&amp;mdash;when Hermione spins the Time-Turner in
the hospital wing.  But, remember, the end of their journey is three
hours &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; its beginning in &lt;em&gt;external&lt;/em&gt; time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s another way of thinking about the difference between external
and personal time, if you&amp;rsquo;re still confused: External time is time in
the third person; personal time is time in the first person.  External
time is the same for everyone; if you could step back and observe the
universe like God, you would watch it progress in external time.
Personal time is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the same for everyone; your personal time
corresponds to your &lt;em&gt;development&lt;/em&gt; through time.  From Harry&amp;rsquo;s
perspective, he appears in the Entrance Hall a few seconds &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt;
Hermione spins the Time-Turner.  He remembers being in the hospital
wing immediately prior, his watch has moved a few seconds forward, and
the physical age of his body is only a few seconds older.  (That last
bit is important: I can be confused about the progress of my own
personal time, like when I wake up and can&amp;rsquo;t remember how long I&amp;rsquo;ve
slept.  But my body has aged a certain number of hours, and I&amp;rsquo;ve moved
&lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; many hours ahead in personal time.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we&amp;rsquo;re talking about the life of a person, and their progress
through history, we use personal time.  Harry fainted at the edge of
the lake, surrounded by Dementors, then woke up in the hospital wing,
&lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; went back in time, &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; cast the Patronus to save himself.
Those events all occurred, and they occurred &lt;em&gt;in that order&lt;/em&gt; for
Harry.  And most importantly, this is a &lt;em&gt;perfectly accurate&lt;/em&gt; way of
describing the events at the end of &lt;em&gt;Prisoner of Azkaban.&lt;/em&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s no
less accurate than a description of those events in external time.
(An external-time description would be: Harry cast the Patronus to
save himself, &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; fainted at the edge of the lake, &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; woke up
in the hospital wing, &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; went back in time.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to think of external time as &lt;em&gt;objective&lt;/em&gt; and personal time
as &lt;em&gt;subjective,&lt;/em&gt; external time as &lt;em&gt;primary&lt;/em&gt; and personal time as
&lt;em&gt;secondary;&lt;/em&gt; but both are equally legitimate.  Personal time isn&amp;rsquo;t
just our &lt;em&gt;opinion&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;feeling&lt;/em&gt; about the passage of time.  Like I
said earlier, we can be unsure about how far we&amp;rsquo;ve proceeded in
personal time: if we are unconscious, we lose the ability to detect
the passage of time.  But there are other, largely objective, ways to
measure how far we move forward in personal time.  When you wake up,
even if &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; think you&amp;rsquo;ve only been asleep for a few minutes, your
watch might say otherwise, and your body will have aged as many hours
as you&amp;rsquo;ve been asleep.  You&amp;rsquo;ve progressed a certain determinate number
of hours in personal time.  And &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; fact&amp;mdash;that you&amp;rsquo;ve moved
forward a number of hours in personal time&amp;mdash;is just as &lt;em&gt;objectively
true&lt;/em&gt; as the fact that you&amp;rsquo;ve moved forward (or backward, if you&amp;rsquo;re
time traveling) a number of hours in external time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Harry and Hermione go back in time, the &lt;em&gt;fact&lt;/em&gt; that only a few
seconds of personal time has elapsed for each of them is just as
objectively true as is the fact that they&amp;rsquo;ve moved backward three
hours in external time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;rsquo;s go back to our original, rough explanation of why it&amp;rsquo;s
impossible to change the past: &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Harry, standing outside and wondering
if he should burst into Hagrid&amp;rsquo;s cabin, can remember sitting inside
with Scabbers.  He can also remember&lt;/em&gt; leaving &lt;em&gt;Hagrid&amp;rsquo;s cabin with
Scabbers, and he remembers nobody bursting in and trying to grab
Scabbers.  His memory is correct&amp;mdash;what he remembers happening is what
happens, so it&amp;rsquo;s too late to try to change it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My appeal to what Harry remembers was a rough way of trying to
describe his journey in terms of &lt;em&gt;personal&lt;/em&gt; time.  Let&amp;rsquo;s write out
this series of events explicitly in terms of personal time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harry saw Hermione find Scabbers in Hagrid&amp;rsquo;s cabin; then left the
cabin with Ron, Hermione and Scabbers; then saw Scabbers escape and
get dragged (with Ron) into the Whomping Willow; then went into the
Shrieking Shack and out again; then fainted at the lake&amp;rsquo;s edge; then
woke up in the hospital wing; then went back in time; &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt;
suggested to Hermione that they burst into Hagrid&amp;rsquo;s cabin and grab
the rat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, these events all occur, and they occur &lt;em&gt;in this order&lt;/em&gt; for
Harry and Hermione.  It&amp;rsquo;s because they occur in this order that when
Harry suggests to Hermione that they burst into Hagrid&amp;rsquo;s cabin, it&amp;rsquo;s
too late.  They &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; left the cabin with Scabbers, and nobody
burst in.  Harry &lt;em&gt;remembers&lt;/em&gt; this&amp;mdash;he remembers being in in the
cabin, and leaving the cabin, with nobody bursting in.  And he
remembers correctly!  That really happened, and it happened long
before Harry suggests he and Hermione burst into Hagrid&amp;rsquo;s cabin, so
there&amp;rsquo;s nothing they can do about it now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;is-the-future-fixed-as-well:eefdcd66b28c2b86ef84bba398f2d59a&#34;&gt;Is the future fixed as well?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ordering events in terms of personal time is no less accurate than
ordering them in terms of external time.  But when we think through
what this means, we&amp;rsquo;ll notice a surprising consequence: if time travel
is possible, then parts of the future are just as fixed as the past
is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s think about Harry&amp;rsquo;s fight with the Dementors at the lake&amp;rsquo;s edge.
Harry, about to collapse, sees his Patronus running across the lake,
back to his future self.  Just because he doesn&amp;rsquo;t recognize himself
doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it&amp;rsquo;s any less true that it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt; on the other side of
the lake.  By the time he faints, he&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; cast the
Patronus&amp;mdash;in external time.  But since this has already happened in
external time, at some point in Harry&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;personal&lt;/em&gt;-time future he will
&lt;em&gt;have to&lt;/em&gt; be at that spot, and he will have to cast the Patronus
Charm.  His future actions must and &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; eventually lead him there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harry, on the verge of collapse at the edge of the lake, has certain
things he is &lt;em&gt;determined&lt;/em&gt; to do in his personal future, because Harry,
standing on the the other side of the lake, is &lt;em&gt;doing those things&lt;/em&gt; at
the very same external time.  But all this shows is that there are
things that Harry has to do at &lt;em&gt;some point&lt;/em&gt; in his personal future.
Isn&amp;rsquo;t there some flexibility about when he gets around to doing them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, no.  We&amp;rsquo;ve agreed that when Harry finally faints at the
edge of the lake, he&amp;rsquo;s already (in terms of external time) cast the
Patronus.  That means that he&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; already done all the individual
actions that brought him to the spot where he cast the Patronus.  He&amp;rsquo;s
already hid in the forest, watching Snape pick up his Invisibility
Cloak; he&amp;rsquo;s already rescued Buckbeak; he&amp;rsquo;s already suggested to
Hermione that they burst into Hagrid&amp;rsquo;s cabin; and he&amp;rsquo;s already
appeared in the Entrance Hall after traveling back in time with
Hermione.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can illustrate Harry&amp;rsquo;s journey through the last chapters of
&lt;em&gt;Prisoner of Azkaban&lt;/em&gt; like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;no-border&#34; src=&#34;http://baruffio.com/img/time-split.png&#34; title=&#34;External time is a horizontal teal line; personal time is a red line curving back to represent backward time travel; the period of time between the beginning of the backward journey in time and its end is fixed.&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt; through &lt;em&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt; represent moments in external
 time.  &lt;em&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt; through &lt;em&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt; represent moments in
 personal time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is when Harry is walking with Ron and Hermione to
visit Hagrid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is when Harry is sitting in Hagrid&amp;rsquo;s cabin with
Ron and Hermione and Scabbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is when Harry faints after being saved by the stag
Patronus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is when Harry watches Hermione spin the Time-Turner
three times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is when Harry is traveling back in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is when Harry appears in the Entrance Hall with
Hermione.  (Only a few seconds separate &lt;em&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;,
&lt;em&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is when Harry is suggesting to Hermione that
they burst into Hagrid&amp;rsquo;s cabin and grab Scabbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is when Harry casts his Patronus for the first time,
driving away the Dementors from across the lake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is when Harry runs with Hermione to the door of the
hospital wing after helping Sirius escape on Buckbeak:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I am going to lock you in,&amp;rdquo; they heard [Dumbledore] saying. &amp;ldquo;It
is five minutes to midnight. Miss Granger, three turns should do
it. Good luck.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dumbledore backed out of the room, closed the door and took out
his wand to magically lock it. Panicking, Harry and Hermione ran
forwards. Dumbledore looked up, and a wide smile appeared under
the long silver moustache. &amp;ldquo;Well?&amp;rdquo; he said quietly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We did it!&amp;rdquo; said Harry breathlessly. &amp;ldquo;Sirius has gone, on
Buckbeak &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dumbledore beamed at them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well done. I think&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo; he listened intently for any sound within
the hospital wing. &amp;ldquo;Yes, I think you&amp;rsquo;ve gone, too&amp;rdquo; (Chapter 22).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at things exclusively from the perspective of external time,
you&amp;rsquo;ll see that &lt;em&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is simultaneous with &lt;em&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and
&lt;em&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and you&amp;rsquo;ll have a hard time seeing why it&amp;rsquo;s too late
for Harry to burst into Hagrid&amp;rsquo;s cabin and grab Scabbers.  But what
I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to show is that the perspective of external time is &lt;em&gt;just a
perspective,&lt;/em&gt; and that it&amp;rsquo;s not the only way to look at time.  When
you look at things from the perspective of Harry&amp;rsquo;s personal time,
&lt;em&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt; are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; simultaneous.  When Harry
is standing outside Hagrid&amp;rsquo;s cabin at &lt;em&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
is long past, and so is his opportunity to seize Scabbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By appreciating both the external and personal perspectives on time,
we can see more clearly how parts of Harry&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;future&lt;/em&gt; are fixed, as
well as his past. At &lt;em&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; Harry is collapsing at the edge
of the lake, but he sees his future self, standing on the other side
of the lake &lt;em&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; He&amp;rsquo;s able to see into his personal future
because &lt;em&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt; are &lt;em&gt;externally&lt;/em&gt;
simultaneous. But the fact that he can see his future means that it&amp;rsquo;s
predetermined. If his future self had walked around the lake and
revived him using &lt;em&gt;Rennervate,&lt;/em&gt; Harry could have told himself, in
perfect detail, everything that he would do in his next three
hours. And there would be nothing Harry &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do but walk that path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all a bit mind-bending, but the upshot is that when Harry goes
back in time three hours, everything that happens during those three
hours is fixed.  Harry already (in personal time) &lt;em&gt;lived&lt;/em&gt; those three
hours, and he can&amp;rsquo;t change that.  He can go back and &lt;em&gt;relive&lt;/em&gt; those
three hours&amp;mdash;which he does&amp;mdash;but he can&amp;rsquo;t undo what he did the first
time around.  Once you&amp;rsquo;ve lived through a period of time, it&amp;rsquo;s fixed;
going back in time doesn&amp;rsquo;t change that.  And it&amp;rsquo;s fixed for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of
us, not just the time-travelers: since Harry&amp;rsquo;s future includes his
casting the Patronus Charm from across the lake, nobody else can
&lt;em&gt;possibly&lt;/em&gt; do anything that would prevent him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might seem alarming and implausible, but think about it: how
could Professor Trelawney make &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; correct predictions otherwise?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;postscript-pottermore-how-about-potter-less:eefdcd66b28c2b86ef84bba398f2d59a&#34;&gt;Postscript: Pottermore? How about Potter&lt;em&gt;less!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://pottermore.com&#34;&gt;Pottermore&lt;/a&gt; entry for
&lt;a href=&#34;http://pottermore.wikia.com/wiki/Time-Turner&#34; title=&#34;Pottermore Wikia&#34;&gt;Time-Turners&lt;/a&gt; includes this alarming statement from Department
of Mysteries employee Saul Croaker:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All attempts to travel back further than a few hours have resulted
in catastrophic harm to the witch or wizard involved. It was not
realised for many years why time travellers over great distances
never survived their journeys. All such experiments have been
abandoned since 1899, when Eloise Mintumble became trapped, for a
period of five days, in the year 1402. Now we understand that her
body had aged five centuries in its return to the present and,
irreparably damaged, she died in St Mungo&amp;rsquo;s Hospital for Magical
Maladies and Injuries shortly after we managed to retrieve her. What
is more, her five days in the distant past caused great disturbance
to the life paths of all those she met, changing the course of their
lives so dramatically that no fewer than twenty-five of their
descendants vanished in the present, having been &amp;ldquo;un-born.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we&amp;rsquo;ve seen, this is impossible.  The notion of time-travel that
exists in the popular imagination and in films like &lt;em&gt;Back to the
Future,&lt;/em&gt; where Marty McFly sees his childhood photos begin to fade
when he threatens to prevent his parents from meeting, are
nonsensical.  We must therefore conclude that the above statement from
Professor Croaker is in error.&lt;/p&gt;

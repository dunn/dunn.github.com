<h2>The Case of the Magical Magnetic Genitals</h2>
</header>
<p>Randi Rabin, J. Edgar Hoover Distinguished Visiting Professor of Feelings at the Noozhawk College of Bullshit, today attempts to tackle a new version of the age old Problem of Friendship. <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/randi_rabin_help_what_happened_to_my_15_year_old_angel" title="Randi Rabin: Help! What Happened to my 15-Year-Old &#39;Angel&#39;?">This iteration, due to noted scholar <strong>Craig in Santa Barbara</strong>, runs thus</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dear Feelings Doctor:</strong> Please answer this “age old” question: Can men and women really be “just friends”? Thanks very much. I just need to know!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Craig in Santa Barbara has spent many years in the field, accosting pairs of men and women in Chaucer’s and asking them “but are you really <em>just</em> friends?” But his results have been entirely inconclusive, and he appealed to our Distinguished Professor to attempt to open up new avenues of research. (His desperate search for an answer to the question that has defined his career is evident: “I just need to know!” he says. But do you really <em>just</em> need to know, Craig?)</p>
<p>Professor Rabin’s analysis is rich and insightful. She deserves a good deal of praise for identifying “the bumpy stage of ‘should we sleep together to see if it’s great or just be friends?’” that inevitably precedes any “friendship attraction” between “women” and “guys”. She also makes the keen observation that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>society has a difficult time figuring out this whole male/female friendship thing. People seem to feel more comfortable when they know what column you go into. It makes everyone feel safer to know that you go into this box or that box. Well, guess what? Fit into a box if you like, but actually, shhh—there really is no box.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a dense bit of argumentation. For most readers, a visual aid may be necessary to clarify what’s going on:</p>
<table>
<col style="width: 18%" /><col style="width: 18%" /><tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;"><p><strong>Woman</strong></p></td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><p><strong>Man</strong></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;"><p>interacts amicably with women</p></td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><p>interacts amicably with men</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Rabin’s thesis is that these are the societal criteria by which we assign gender to individuals. If they interact amicably with women, they are a woman, and amicable interaction with men is a necessary and sufficient condition for being a man.</p>
<p>These criteria are clearly problematic, but Rabin’s criticism of them is difficult to understand at first. What are we to make of her claim that “there really is no box”? She cannot be saying merely that gender is socially constructed, for that does not make it any less real. By saying there is no box, or are no boxes, she appears to be denying the reality of gender in any sense at all.</p>
<p>Her final paragraph will only confuse the casual reader:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Besides, being best friends with the opposite sex can be an illuminating, fulfilling experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those not simply bewildered by the progression of her thoughts may accuse her of lazily conflating sex and gender, but I believe that in fact she’s making a very subtle and clever point about our society’s view of gender relations. By taking Craig from Santa Barbara’s question about the <em>gendered</em> categories of <em>woman</em> and <em>man</em> and gradually moving to a discussion of the <em>sexual</em> categories of <em>female</em> and <em>male</em>, our J. Edgar Hoover Distinguished Visiting Professor of Feelings is demonstrating how this most idiotic of questions—can men and women be friends?—can only emerge from a simplistic view of men and women as necessarily both heterosexual and cissexual. Only by (1) ignoring the existence of gay, lesbian and transgender individuals, (2) seeing sex and gender as synonymous, and (3) probably being pretty emotionally immature could anyone take that to be an open question worthy of serious discussion.</p>
<p>Rabin’s scathing piece undeniably means the end of Craig from Santa Barbara’s research program. When reached for comment, he was surprisingly upbeat, however, saying that he now has time to study where babies come from.</p>

<h2>How To Be Racist After Paula Deen</h2>
</header>
<p>The <a href="http://www.latimes.com/features/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-anne-rice-defends-paula-deen-against-lynch-mob-20130625,0,7208709.story" title="Anne Rice defends Paula Deen against &#39;lynch mob&#39;">lynching</a> of gentle soul <a href="http://gawker.com/i-is-what-i-is-paula-deen-sobs-in-tense-today-interv-583684774" title="&quot;I Is What I Is,&quot; Paula Deen Sobs in Tense *Today* Interview">Paula Deen</a> has had a chilling effect on other American racists. How are they to exercise their right to <a href="https://twitter.com/squeenlatifah/status/350024436939898881" title="Tweet by @squeenlatifa on 26 June 2013">free speech</a> when there are such consequences? Your average racist could not be blamed for simply packing it in.</p>
<p>But Julia Chaplin is not your average racist. Her bigotry is sophisticated and subtle, as demonstrated by <a href="http://sbmag.com/2013/06/bohemian-rhapsody/" title="Bohemian Rhapsody">a recent feature in <em>Santa Barbara Magazine</em></a>. The “style” she promotes involves some egregious cultural appropriation, particularly against Indigenous American peoples, and her books are boldly titled with the portmanteau <a href="http://www.gypset.com/">“gypset”</a>, the combination of “jet-set” and a <a href="http://www.rsdb.org/race/gypsy" title="The Racial Slur Database entry for &quot;gypsy&quot;">racial slur used against the Romani people</a>. But none of this is mentioned in the interview; Chaplin and “her band of friends, artists, musicians, and otherworldly vivants” are described as “a disheveled, chic, colorfully elegant tribe that turns heads”.</p>
<p>How did Julia Chaplin get away with this sort of behavior in our politically-correct dystopia? We sat down with her (<em>we did not</em>) and asked her how to be racist after Paula Deen.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/dunndunndunn" title="Twitter for @dunndunndunn"><strong>CAT:</strong></a> First off, congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>JC:</strong> Thank you! In a time when you can get in trouble for <a href="http://thisweekinblackness.com/2013/07/01/white-feminists-netroots/" title="This Week in Blackness: White Feminists: Step Your Game Up">using stock photography instead of finding a single image of a feminist of color</a>, I feel like I’ve really beat the odds here.</p>
<p><strong>CAT:</strong> How do you think you got away with perpetuating racist stereotypes against <em>multiple</em> groups with very little protest? During my exhaustive research I found only one <a href="http://madamethursday.tumblr.com/post/26627290176/image-a-very-racist-appropriative-photo-of-a">Tumblr chain letter</a> and a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HYW6F8COMLH/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=2759403963&amp;linkCode=&amp;nodeID=&amp;tag=">one-star review on Amazon of your book <em>Gypset Style</em></a>.</p>
<p><strong>JC:</strong> There are a few things I did that Paula Deen failed to do. First, the groups I went after are even more marginalized than the Black community is. Racism directed at Indigenous and <a href="http://gypsyappropriations.blogspot.com/2010/07/truth-about-gypsy-life.html" title="The Truth About &#39;Gypsy Life&#39;">Romani</a> peoples remains acceptable in a way anti-Black racism isn’t. Remember that just recently <a href="../docs/lucidity.html" title="When You&#39;re Lucid Dreaming You Can Do Anything But That Includes Being Racist">a music festival was hosted in your own backyard</a> that engaged in blatant appropriation of various Indigenous cultures, and another local magazine devoted <a href="http://www.ventanamonthly.com/issue.php?IssueNum=79" title="Ventana Magazine: On the Gypsy Trail">half an issue</a> to playing on <a href="https://staticnonsense.wordpress.com/2011/04/23/tw-the-bullshit-of-gypsy-magic-in-the-pagan-community/" title="[tw] the bullshit of &#39;gypsy magic&#39; in the pagan community">the racist trope of “gypsy magic.”</a>.</p>
<p><strong>CAT:</strong> Good points. And there’s probably something to be said for committing some appropriation against different groups, rather than going all-in on one.</p>
<p><strong>JC:</strong> Exactly, you want to diffuse the response. There’s no one group that I’ve single-mindedly victimized; that was the mistake of Lucidity Festival.</p>
<p><strong>CAT:</strong> So the lessons are to choose multiple groups that remain incredibly vulnerable and spread the damage around.</p>
<p><strong>JC:</strong> Correct!</p>
<p><strong>CAT:</strong> Well, this has been very enlightening. Thank you so much for your time.</p>
<p><strong>JC:</strong> It’s been a pleasure.</p>

<h2>Craig Smith Is A Zombie And Should Not Be Allowed On Airplanes</h2>
</header>
<p>The release of a <a href="http://www.independent.com/news/2013/jun/26/world-war-z/" title="SB Independent: World War Z">bad movie</a> with some curious <a href="http://mattcornell.org/blog/2013/06/where-the-z-stands-for-zionism/" title="Matt Cornell: Where the Z Stands for Zionism">political undertones</a> has the the thinking public thinking again about that most <a href="https://twitter.com/adeerable/status/347688205337911296" title="Tweet from @adeerable on 20 June 2013">Serious</a> of problems: the zombie menace. As any student of anti-zombie strategy knows, the most important thing is to quickly identify and eliminate infected members of your community. Therefore I feel compelled to warn Santa Barbara residents that our own Craig Smith may be a zombie.</p>
<p>The evidence comes in the form of today’s blog post, in which <a href="http://craigsmithsblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/the-mile-high-club-needs-to-stay.html" title="The Mile High Club Needs to Stay Powered Down">he appears to admit to having “died”</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When it comes to electronic gadgets and devices, I’m a little like Charlton Heston was when it came to his gun. The only way you are going to take my iPhone away from me is to, “pry it from my cold, dead hand.” The same goes for my iPad and my Nexus 7 tablet. However, despite my attachment to these gadgets, I think the time and energy spent by the FAA on repealing the rule that electronic devices need to be powered off and put away during take-off and landing is a bad idea. The rule as it stands (“if it has an on/off switch it needs to be off) is just fine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Craig Smith will only stop using his iPhone when he is “dead”, but he <em>has</em> stopped using his phone when flying! The only possibility is that he goes into some sort of zombie fugue when boarding an airplane. What is most shocking about this revelation is the fact that he apparently recovers upon landing. Traditionally, zombies have been thought to be permanently undead. This is a disturbing development.</p>
<p>(Many of you will point out that Smith says he only dies when his phone is taken from his hands, not when it is turned off. True enough, but the implication is clear. It would be a gross non sequitur to make such a claim in the context of a discussion of the FAA’s rules for the use of electronics.)</p>
<p>A zombie on an airplane is a terrifying idea, for it allows the rapid spread of contagion. Warnings about public safety, therefore, sound pretty hollow coming from Smith:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If indeed, the most critical time on an airplane is during take-off and landing shouldn’t passengers be ready to be alerted to the possibility that an emergency is imminent? You shouldn’t be playing Angry Birds and be oblivious to the fact that everyone else is panicked because the bird you are flying on is going down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But this clumsy attempt to deflect attention from his own disease only further highlights Smith’s affliction. No passenger could be so engrossed in a game to fail to notice that their plane is crashing; but Smith, being always zombified during flight, is not aware of this. Likewise he does not realize that electronic devices are allowed to be on during the majority of the flight, proclaiming that “if they ever allow passengers to talk on cell phones during the flight, I’ll be done with flying.”</p>
<p>Let’s hope Craig Smith does stop flying, for the good of us all. In particular, though, it may make the flight attendants more comfortable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I remember a few years ago I was on a plane about to depart from JFK when a passenger was still gabbing on her cell phone even though the flight attendants were giving the safety instructions and the plane was taxiing down the runway. Apparently this passenger didn’t find the “Delta Girl” anywhere near as captivating as I do.</p>

<h2>Point-Counterpoint: Kill the Homeless, or Just Treat Them Like Animals?</h2>
</header>
<p>The most pressing question for residents of our fair city is <em>how do we get rid of the sorts of people we don’t like?</em> Finding an answer to this question is urgent due to the very large number of people we find objectionable: <a href="http://www.independent.com/news/2013/may/16/heated-debate-over-gang-injunction/" title="SB Independent: Heated Debate Over Gang Injunction">young men of color</a>, <a href="http://thebottomline.as.ucsb.edu/2013/05/violent-altercation-breaks-out-in-iv-provoked-by-homophobic-remarks" title="Violent Altercation Breaks Out in IV, Provoked By Homophobic Remarks">gender, sexual, and romantic minorities (GSRMs)</a>, and <em>especially</em> the homeless.</p>
<p>As much as we dislike people who look and love other than we do, our most righteous fury is reserved for those who—outrageously—find themselves living on the street. We therefore owe the <em>Santa Barbara View</em> our gratitude for hosting a debate on what to do with these filthy individuals who remind us, unfairly and distressingly, of the grave inequality in our society. Those who have recently taken to existing on State Street are particularly galling, given that the <em>point</em> of going to State Street is to forget about all that.</p>
<p>So something has to be done. But what?</p>
<p>Doctor Loretta Redd, PhD (she has a PhD, everyone), asks us to see the homeless population as a band of stray animals. One should not necessarily feed the strays, but rather support the shelters that are equipped to care for them. The analogy is apt: <a href="http://www.santabarbaraview.com/more-givingless-helping-santa-barbara6535387/" title="More Giving=Less Helping">“It is time to face the harm we are doing by giving money to those unable to use it wisely,”</a>, writes Redd (who has a PhD), making the obvious but often-overlooked point that a house or apartment is a precondition of rationality. She suggests that instead of feeding these anthropomorphized seagulls, we</p>
<blockquote>
<p>follow the Atlanta model, and <strong>install “giving meters”</strong> on sidewalks, or on private property if owners are willing, where the money could be collected and transferred to programs of transitional housing or intensive professional service to assist those addicted to substances.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An interesting proposal, but not one that is to the liking of Dr. Redd’s sparring partner in this online debate. Sharon Byrne (who does <em>not</em>, apparently, have a PhD), argues that <a href="http://www.santabarbaraview.com/the-business-of-homelessness-in-santa-barbara/" title="The Business of Homelessness in Santa Barbara, California">shelters like Casa Esperanza have existed for a number of years and continue to pay their employees</a>, proof of their profound corruption. Moreover,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For all the money that has been spent, is still being spent, and what it’s being spent on …</p>
<p>How well is the city really tackling this issue?</p>
<p>Could it be done better?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are, of course, rhetorical questions, since we know that <a href="http://www.santabarbaraview.com/whose-city-is-it-anyway2542252/" title="Whose City Is It, Anyway?">truly helping other people is tree-hugger bullshit</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Some suggest that we] <strong>stop Wall St Greed, and end the disparity between rich and poor to solve homelessness.</strong> Sure, we’ll get right on that. No one’s solved it in decades, but let Santa Barbara lead the charge!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in any case, Sharon Byrne has done extensive research and discovered that “the bench occupiers [on State Street] aren’t homeless.” (She has not released the data supporting this claim, presumably because she plans on publishing her findings and is afraid of academic plagiarism. Understandable.)</p>
<p>What, then, is Byrne’s suggestion? How are we do deal with this plague of undesirables? She, unfortunately, has no answers, but recognizes that this question is of <a href="http://www.santabarbaraview.com/whose-city-is-it-anyway2542252/" title="Whose City Is It, Anyway?">existential import</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whose city is it, anyway???</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If homeless youths are allowed to remain in Santa Barbara, Sharon Byrne is gone. Much as in the pitiful case of <a href="http://www.independent.com/news/2013/jun/14/sidewalk-weapons/" title="Terrorists on Wheels">a woman driven out of town by terrorists</a>, it is perfectly clear who we would rather have living in our city.</p>

<h2>Critical Thinking for Racists</h2>
</header>
<p>One of the most important aspects of teaching is the use of apt examples to illustrate key points. If an educator fails to show how a subject is applicable to real problems, students may find it abstract, pointless, and unworthy of their attention.</p>
<p>It is particularly crucial to remember this when discussing <em>fallacies</em>. We commit fallacies—errors in reasoning—on a daily basis, but studying them in the context of <em>logic</em> or <em>critical thinking</em> can lead to one’s pupils treating them as academic issues, rather than faults which can negatively affect many aspects of our lives. It is very fortunate, therefore, that <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/061713_henry_schulte_immigration_reform/" title="Noozhawk: If We Would Use the Process Already in Place, We Wouldn&#39;t Need Immigration &#39;Reform&#39;">Henry Schulte has taken to the pages of today’s <em>Noozhawk</em></a> to demonstrate vividly how we frequently commit fallacies in our ordinary thinking.</p>
<p>Schulte draws his examples from a fictional polemic against immigration reform. His fictional author, railing against the imagined evils brought about by undocumented immigration, makes an illustrative series of fallacies that are highly instructive.</p>
<p>First Schulte addresses the <a href="http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/appeal-to-ridicule.html" title="The Nizkor Project: Appeal to Ridicule"><em>appeal to ridicule</em></a>. His op-ed writer tells a story about moving to China on a visa and remaining there for 20 years, presumably against Chinese law. When his undocumented status is discovered, he is arrested. He sarcastically <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/061713_henry_schulte_immigration_reform/" title="Noozhawk: If We Would Use the Process Already in Place, We Wouldn&#39;t Need Immigration &#39;Reform&#39;">laments his plight</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I don’t get is after all these years of living and working there, how come I couldn’t get a bunch of free stuff and become a Chinese citizen?</p>
<p>Sound ridiculous? It is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By treating healthcare, security, voting rights, and other benefits of citizenship as “free stuff”, the (invented) opinion writer trivializes the often life-saving rights conferred to citizens and denied to others in a cynical attempt to convince readers to ignore their importance and instead think of the less-privileged as <a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/14/romney-blames-loss-on-obamas-gifts-to-minorities-and-young-voters/" title="Romney Blames Loss on Obama&#39;s &#39;Gifts&#39; to Minorities and Young Voters">moochers looking for gifts</a>.</p>
<p>It’s of course <em>not</em> ridiculous to think that a person who has lived somewhere for two decades and become part of that society has some claim to stay, but Schulte shows here how the impression that it <em>is</em> can be easily produced in an incautious mind.</p>
<p>The next example is not of a fallacy, strictly speaking, but it is noteworthy all the same:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We already have a process [for immigration] in place that has been working just fine for those who follow the law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is simply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Bullshit" title="Wikipedia: On Bullshit">bullshit</a>. The claim that the existing immigration system is perfectly functional is <a href="http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/04/12/17709883-waiting-half-a-life-for-a-green-card-families-languish-in-immigration-line?lite" title="Waiting half a life for a green card: Families languish in immigration line">obviously false</a>, but our devious (and thankfully nonexistent) author presents this claim with such confidence that some readers may take it as fact. Those who see through it will likely treat the rest of the article with skepticism, so this sort of flagrant bullshitting is a risky strategy.</p>
<p>Schulte next provides two passages that exemplify the <a href="http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/straw-man.html" title="Nizkor Project: Straw Man"><em>straw man fallacy</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The left has hammered us for so long with the need for immigration reform that it’s made many believe it’s now a requirement. And they try to guilt those who are opposed as racist and cold-hearted who don’t care about the lives of other people. What about the lives and welfare of American citizens?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>…</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The debate isn’t over whether immigrants work hard or contribute something to the American society; it’s how come we’re being forced to change our policy to accommodate one group over another.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here our delusional author (the product of a truly creative mind) combines another bit of bullshit—the outrageous claim that <em>white Americans are being oppressed</em> by undocumented immigrants—with a gross distortion of the position held by those who advocate immigration reform. Comprehensive reform—even the sort of idealistic reform that would allow free movement across borders—is not an attempt to “accommodate” one group over another. Nor do those who seek such reform care more about immigrants than citizens. Reform activists care about the welfare of <em>all</em> people, and loathe discriminatory policies (such as ours) that treat immigrants and non-citizens as second-class.</p>
<p>Next we get what I’ll call the <em>fallacy of ambiguity</em>. Our imaginary writer has turned to the invented problem known as “Who Will Pay For All These Lazy Immigrants?” He claims that they will not themselves contribute via taxes, because <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/061713_henry_schulte_immigration_reform/" title="Noozhawk: If We Would Use the Process Already in Place, We Wouldn&#39;t Need Immigration &#39;Reform&#39;">“already half the country doesn’t pay a dime as it is.”</a></p>
<p>What is true is that <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/18/mitt-romney/romney-says-47-percent-americans-pay-no-income-tax/" title="Politifact: Mitt Romney says 47 percent of Americans pay no income tax">about half of US citizens do not pay <em>income</em> tax</a>; but most of these individuals still pay sales taxes, property taxes, Social Security taxes, and other non-income taxes. Schulte’s fake demagogue intends for readers to understand him to be referring to <em>all</em> taxes, when his statement is only anything close to true if he is taken to be talking about only the income tax.</p>
<p>Next he bemoans the supposedly uncivilized nature of immigrants, exposing us in the process to the <a href="http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/spotlight.html" title="Nizkor Project: Spotlight"><em>spotlight fallacy</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And keep in mind there is a vast segment of these immigrants responsible for domestic violence, gangs, drugs, drunken driving and human smuggling. You only need to read the paper to see the result of this everyday. This isn’t racist, it’s factual.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Regrettably, for the hardworking portion of immigrants this bad element taints the entire group, but in the end we all suffer for it and it’s only getting worse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mainstream media traffics in sensationalism and race-baiting, so it is thoroughly unsurprising that stories involving crime, especially crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, receive a great deal of coverage. But it is obviously fallacious to take that unbalanced coverage and use it to make a gross generalization about immigrants as a group.</p>
<p>This fallacy is followed by a series of bold rhetorical moves. Our imaginary polemicist recognizes that his characterization of immigrants will be seen as a cheap bit of racist fear-mongering, so:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>He insists that his racist claims are in fact just factual descriptions of how the world is. This move was performed most audaciously by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bell_Curve" title="Wikipedia: The Bell Curve">Herrnstein and Murray</a>, and has recently come to the public consciousness again thanks to Heroic Freethinker <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/05/08/heritage-study-co-author-opposed-letting-in-immigrants-with-low-iqs/" title="Heritage study co-author opposed letting in immigrants with low IQs">Jason Richwine</a>. Of course, this is just more bullshit.</p></li>
<li><p>He <em>actually admits</em> that he’s making an unfair (and racist) generalization about a class of individuals, but—regrettably!—insists that it’s justified to do so. It’s a truly breathtaking maneuver.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Our last fallacy is some twisted variation on the <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/at/sunk_cost_fallacy/" title="LessWrong: Sunk Cost Fallacy"><em>sunk cost fallacy</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And how is this [immigration reform] fair for all those who have struggled through the legal process, waited years and spent thousands of dollars to do it the right way? For one thing, it diminishes their pride in becoming an American citizen after all their hard efforts. They would have to ask themselves why they bothered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exactly! It wouldn’t be fair to the <em>other immigrants</em>, who had the time and resources to navigate the nightmarish immigration process, if all of a sudden it was made easier for <em>everyone</em> to cross borders. They spent thousands of dollars and waited decades to come to the United States, and now other people don’t have to? Why even bother coming after all?</p>
<p>Because in the world of Harry Schulte, you’re only doing well if someone else is doing much, much worse.</p>

<h2>A Small Business Success (Take That, Obama!)</h2>
</header>
<p>Life has not been easy for small business owners of the Caucasian persuasion since Black Spy Barack Hussein Obama passed the Reparations Act of Reverse Racism (RARR!). Good, hardworking Americans have found their already-shrinking incomes further taxed to pay for the data plans of Obamaphones, which are then used by Welfare-Americans to shop online and put local stores out of business. Just such a fate recently befell area White man Jan Koch (relationship to the Koch brothers unknown), whose Travel Store is <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/travel_store_closes_doors_after_29_years/" title="Travel Store of Santa Barbara Packing It In After 29 Years">closing its doors this month</a>.</p>
<p>But despite the increasingly dystopian nature of the country as it slides toward an inevitable race war, some hero entrepreneurs have refused to take the easy way out (food stamps) and have valiantly started a profitable business despite the best efforts of the Obama regime. Success has not come easily for <a href="http://sbmag.com/2013/06/15556/" title="Santa Barbara Magazine: Jet Set">David and Healey Young</a>, who live a Spartan existence while their pour all their resources into staying afloat.</p>

<p>The severe difficulties that the Youngs have faced have given them a humble, grounded perspective on life. Says Healey:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I love classics toughened up with edgy pieces. I’ll pair a checkered oxford with a pouf skirt and insanely high ankle-risking Lanvin wedges. I love L.A. designer Gladys Tamez’s hats. And vintage pool dresses when they’re least expected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>David is equally modest, admitting only with embarrassment that “I discovered the Santa Barbara-band Dishwalla, so I have a gold record for their first album <em>Pet Your Friends</em>.” He also makes a self-conscious reference to his signed poster of Green Day’s <em>American Idiot</em>. It is rumored that the album name is in fact a reference to David Young.</p>
<p>The vocation that the Youngs have sacrificed everything for is a thankless one. They run a private “jet charter service”—a misleading title for a business that is little more than an air taxi operator. David and Healey fly the planes themselves, and are continually at the mercy of <a href="http://popdust.com/2012/11/19/rihanna-air-naked-in-the-aisles/" title="Pop Dust: Air Rihanna: Nudity, Talk of Mutiny and the Smell of Hot Processed Cheese and Fear">Obama’s nouveau rich</a>. Often they are treated as glorified UPS drivers; David recalls the humiliation he felt when he “flew a tuxedo to its owner on a Citation X, the world’s fastest civilian jet.”</p>
<p>For all their suffering, the two refuse to go into detail about the debauched behavior of their passengers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What happens at 40,000 feet stays at 40,000 feet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But their reticence may only be due to the fact that their livelihood is continually at risk—one disgruntled call from an Obamaphone could put them on the streets.</p>

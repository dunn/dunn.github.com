<h2>Creating a Beast: Women’s Health and Social Noise</h2>
</header>
<p>The idea of PMS as a great hormonal tide that washes away women’s rationality does not, of course, correspond to reality. Many were probably nonetheless shocked last year when University of Toronto researchers published a literature review suggesting that <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/10/pms-and-the-wandering-womb/263398/" title="James Hamblin: PMS and the Wandering Womb">many of the phenomena attributed to PMS may have their source elsewhere</a>. (Among those unsurprised by their findings was surely Emile Nelson, who has long insisted that <a href="../dn/hump.html" title="How To Have Sex While Hating Yourself And Others">women never had any rationality to begin with</a>.) Dr. Sarah Romans even suggested that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the whole PMS notion serves to keep women non-irritable, sweet, and compliant the rest of the time. There is a range of paradoxes—world-turned-upside-down events—like festivals, Mardi Gras, where people are socially prescribed to behave out of role. In Europe in medieval times there’d be one day a year where the lord would serve his own servants and workers, and then the rest of the time it’s the other way, servant obeying the master. And these kinds of rituals serve to embed the normal behavior. I think PMS is a bit like that. “We’ll let you be cranky and bad-tempered now, but just for one or two days. The rest of the time you’ve got to be like a true woman.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s been almost a year since Romans et al. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550857912001349" title="ScienceDirect: Mood and the Menstrual Cycle: A Review of Prospective Data Studies">published their results</a> in <em>Gender Medicine</em>. Did this finally change our narratives about women’s emotionality? Starshine Roshell took to the <em>Independent</em> today to issue a <a href="http://www.independent.com/news/2013/aug/14/pms-safety-guide-men/" title="PMS: A Safety Guide for Men">pessimistic progress report</a>.</p>
<p>Roshell’s column contains two distinct threads. One is a straightforward exposition of what should, by now, be obvious:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m sure you’d love to be able to dismiss our emotional extremes as the hormone-fueled flare-ups of an estrogen-addled lunatic rather than have to consider whether you’ve actually done something wrong (HOW HARD IS IT TO PICK A DIFFERENT FORK?). But it’s not like we’re schizophrenic, possessed by the devil, or on a bender; we’re still us, reacting to genuine feelings about real things.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>…</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s worth reminding you that men behave unpredictably and unpleasantly from time to time: The teenaged boy who roars from sulking to rage in 60 seconds flat, the grown man who grows despondent when we’re out of coffee or snippy when he misses his morning workout … Those chemical surges’ll mess with your mind!</p>
<p>But if empathy alone won’t keep you from playing the condescending “You’ve got PMS” card, then do it for your own safety. Because when you dismiss our concerns—deranged as they may seem—as the bogus byproducts of a biological function, it belittles our distress and defines us as poorly engineered, malfunctioning freaks.</p>
<p>Once we’ve been labeled with the scarlet P, we can no longer be heard; even legitimate worries and reasonable frustrations are ignored as involuntary theatrics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But woven between these paragraphs is another thread that disrupts and confuses the points being made. It is the trope of PMS-induced hysteria, which Roshell introduces to show that the old story is still the one being told:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have arrived, yet again, at that odious interlude of each lunar cycle when there is a small chance that I will throw something heavy at your head. There’s also a chance that during the next three days I will snatch something out of your hands because you are doing it wrong, shriek “WHO ATE THE LAST BROWNIE?” at a pterodactyl pitch, and begin weeping inconsolably because you set the table and gave me that fork I don’t like—that one freaking fork that is so easy to avoid in the utensils drawer and that you know very well I dislike, but you just had to put it at my place, didn’t you? You never have respected me, not for one minute of our lives, and this is how you choose to show me.</p>
<p>Welcome to hell, fellas.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>…</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Your wife/mother/girlfriend/sister is a porcupine who has swallowed a hand grenade and doesn’t want to die alone. But with a steady supply of wine and simple carbohydrates, she might—might—be able to keep The Beast shackled in the basement of her soul.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Roshell’s intention is clearly to illustrate how even the most sensible conversation about menstruation takes place against the backdrop the bad old narrative. Not only is this sort of conversation constantly at risk of being actively derailed by the invocation of that backdrop, but decades of sexism and misinformation have lead listeners to immediately associate such conversations with problematic myths. The second thread of Roshell’s column can therefore be thought of as the social noise in the background of any discussion of women’s emotions, perpetually distracting us from what really matters.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this strategy is actually too effective because all we’re going to get out of this column is that women</p>
<blockquote>
<p>have no option but to cash in that free pass, stop trying to tame our tempers, and erupt in a delirious streak of long-overdue, blame-my-uterus, full-volume flipping freak-outs.</p>
<p>Gentlemen … meet The Beast.</p>

<h2>Announcing <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/letter_to_the_editor_announcing_write-in_candidacy_for_mayor_20130809">Reven Steynalds’</a> Write-In Candidacy for Mayor</h2>
</header>
<p><a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/letter_to_the_editor_announcing_write-in_candidacy_for_mayor_20130809">Dear Santa Barbara,</a></p>
<p>I’ve decided to enter the race for mayor as a write-in candidate. As our newly elected mayor, my first order of business will enure that all official correspondence takes the form of rhetorical questions.</p>
<p>Let’s brush aside my qualifications and everything else that’s relevant and discuss an issue the surface of which was barely scratched. If I am so adept at this art of misdirection already, will I not be an admirable politician?</p>
<p>Now that I’ve hitched my announcement of candidacy to the police chief’s idea for a door-to-door campaign to discuss the “homeless problem”—a topic that will only interest the people who comment at the <em>Santa Barbara View</em>—how about we dishonestly suppose that such a campaign is motivated by some general principle, and then generalize that principle in the hopes of deriving some absurd conclusion?</p>
<p>Doesn’t it say something about my priorities that this is the most important thing I can think to write about?</p>
<p>Most importantly, have you learned anything about me and my political views in this letter?</p>
<p>Thank you for your time. I hope to see you at the next City Council meeting.</p>
<p>— Reven C. Steynalds, <em>Santa Barbara</em></p>

<h2>A Comedy of Errors</h2>
</header>
<p>All publications are prone to mistakes, and the <em>Santa Barbara View</em> is no exception. But the <em>View</em> has made some major slips recently. Two weeks ago they transposed some key words in Sharon Byrne’s <a href="liberal.html" title="A New Argument for Moral Relativism">essay on moral philosophy</a>, and today they have committed a much graver error, accidentally publishing <a href="http://www.santabarbaraview.com/rewarding-bad-behavior56536/" title="Rewarding Bad Behavior">draft notes</a>—made by Loretta Redd, PhD on a variety of topics—as a single essay.</p>
<p>Professor Redd apparently created a draft post to collect her thoughts on a number of different topics—manipulation of the media, rape culture, technology and pornography, teaching healthy sexuality—but someone accidentally hit “Publish” on the lot. The <a href="http://www.santabarbaraview.com/rewarding-bad-behavior56536/" title="Rewarding Bad Behavior">result</a> unfortunately (and most assuredly unintentionally) conflates healthy and unhealthy sexuality, pathologizes women’s agency, places Paula Deen alongside sexual predators, and gives the impression that Loretta Redd has no understanding of either technology or pornography.</p>
<p>One of Redd’s essays was apparently intended to juxtapose <a href="http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/sexist/2009/09/11/the-rapiest-quotes-from-i-hope-they-serve-beer-in-hell/" title="The Rapiest Quotes From &quot;I Hope They Serve Beer In Hell&quot;">rape apologist</a> Tucker Max with Anthony Weiner, Bob Filner, and Herman Cain, who have used their positions of power to (so far) avoid prosecution for repeated sexual harassment. No doubt the point was to illustrate how our willingness to excuse “bad boys” like Max and politicians like Weiner, Filner and Cain are equally dangerous aspects of rape culture. But somehow a short rant about Paula Deen was inserted into the middle of that piece, seriously disrupting the flow. Readers are likely to lose the thread, and wonder whether she’s writing about specifically male privilege or the entitlement of the powerful in general (or even that Paula Deen is also a sexual predator!).</p>
<p>Unfortunately things quickly get even worse for the unwitting reader, as another random bit of text has been tacked onto the end of that section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The rapid decline of what once passed as morality seems to go hand-in-hand with the rise of access to our impersonal digital connections. <strong>Men aren’t alone in the decline</strong>; women who show their bodies on social media, who drink like fish, and behave like frat boys aren’t helping to chart a map for morality or do much to hold men accountable for acting out their fantasies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Presumably this is a quote from Ross Douthat or some other benevolent sexist who Loretta Redd (PhD) was planning on critiquing. She may have meant to expand her article on rape culture to cover how the sentiments expressed in this quote—that women being able to choose how to present their bodies is dangerous, that women behaving in stereotypically masculine ways is wrong, and that women are responsible for controlling inherently irresponsible men—subtly reinforces the idea that women who “act out” are asking for trouble. But instead, the effect of this quote, coming right after Redd’s remarks about the moral depravity of Weiner et al., may lead the incautious reader to think that Loretta Redd, PhD is suggesting that Weiner’s behavior and the increasing autonomy of women are both aspects of the same (imaginary) moral decline.</p>
<p>We then make another jump. Redd was apparently planning on later publishing a piece about the impact of technology on pornography. It’s obvious that this was intended to be a subsequent article because she makes a cute reference to her article about Weiner and Filner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t know if Mr. Weiner or Mayor Filner in San Diego spend hours engaged in on-line pornography, but I wouldn’t be surprised.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Her notes contain some statistics about pornography consumption by young people today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Jennings Bryant, in a review of 600 third-year high school students discovered that 91% of males and 82% of females had been exposed to explicit on-line pornography.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>…</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>With the advent of search engines, M. Ybarra and K. Mitchell of <strong>Internet Solutions for Kids, Inc.</strong>, declare in their study on this subject that deliberate exposure to pornographic sites is now surpassing that of accidental exposure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s hard to say what the objective of this column was to be, because these notes are mixed up with some quotes pulled from—I can only guess—the American Family Association:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our children under the age of 12 are being exposed to pornography with devastating impact on healthy age-appropriate sexual development.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>…</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The imagery is far beyond their years and can permanently distort beliefs about sexual aggression or the treatment of women.</p>
<p>In decades past, teenage sexual curiosities were satisfied by peering at the nubile breasts or male nudity of some Old Master’s paintings or sneaking a peek at a big brother’s copy of Playboy. Today’s world is far more graphic, emotionally more jarring, and physically more dangerous because limits to access are becoming more difficult to maintain.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>…</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There isn’t anything healthy for anyone about internet pornography … There isn’t anything appropriate about pre-pubescent children gaining access to images that can distort their concept of human relations forever.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The result of this mistake, which I’m sure nobody regrets more than Loretta Redd, PhD, is to suggest that the fact that relatively fewer young people are accidentally stumbling across porn is itself a crisis, and that teens were <em>healthier</em> when their sexual desires were more stigmatized than they are now.</p>
<p>No doubt the former notes were the beginnings of Redd’s article on the need for more comprehensive sex education that encourages safety and consent instead of ignorance and fear, and the need not for internet filters but <a href="http://stavvers.wordpress.com/2013/07/22/not-that-porn-blocking-bollocks-again/" title="Stavvers: Not that porn-blocking bollocks again">better porn</a> that itself teaches healthy sexuality. And surely the latter quotes were to be gleefully torn apart as the moral panic of those with reactionary views of sexuality.</p>
<p>It’s too bad that these sketchy but promising ideas were published prematurely. And the second half of the essay is also peppered with some unrelated psychological musings on the possibility of sexual pathology as an explanation for why Anthony Weiner was compelled to ruin his career for a few dick pics.</p>
<p>I trust, however, that this error will be addressed, and that eventually we will see the full flowering of Loretta Redd’s intellect.</p>

<h2>Born Into Trouble</h2>
</header>
<p>We have long been awaiting new work from Sue Ahlgren, who rose to fame in January after publishing an exhaustively-researched article in the <em>Montecito Journal</em> arguing for the unintuitive but apparently true claim that <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/120570735/LEGALLY-BLONDE" title="Food For Too Many, page 9">poor people are lazy</a>. And she has at last delivered. In the <em>Santa Barbara Independent</em> today, Ahlgren carefully sifts through the history of <a href="http://www.ijfab.org/blog/they-all-wanted-it-done-eugenics-now-showing-in-a-state-prison-near-you/" title="IJFAB: &quot;They all wanted it done&quot;: Eugenics---Now Showing In A State Prison Near You!">eugenics in California</a>—in light of revelations that <a href="http://cironline.org/reports/female-inmates-sterilized-california-prisons-without-approval-4917" title="Center for Investigative Reporting: Female inmates sterilized in California prisons without approval">forced sterilizations have continued to be performed in prisons</a> until as recently as 2010—and concludes that somewhere around 2006 this practice ceased being a form of state-sponsored genocide against women of color and those with disabilities and instead became a responsible choice by those who finally realized that their decision to be a minority was <a href="http://www.independent.com/news/2013/jul/27/issues-not-inmates/" title="Issues, Not Inmates">reckless and unwise</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These are woman in federal prison, some with mental instability, who have accepted the counsel of health professionals in prison and decided that maybe, given their lifestyle, it would be prudent for them not to have more children. No doubt they came to the conclusion that repeated lawbreaking and incarceration is no way to raise a child.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ahlgren accordingly takes State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson to task for trying to position herself as an “advocate” for these women. Jackson, blinded by her privilege, presumes to speak for these women and erase their agency when they can speak perfectly well for themselves and have freely and happily placed themselves in the care of a prison system that has been entirely open about its mission of absolutely destroying them.</p>
<p>The only weakness of Ahlgren’s article is its terseness: her argument, against the historical consensus that forced sterilization is forced, is concise to a fault. Here it is in its entirety:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><br /> <br /> <br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The argument just quoted obviously requires some elaboration, so I will attempt to flesh out Ahlgren’s thesis.</p>
<p>Why would any person of color, or disabled person, who has a uterus, and is in a racist, sexist, and ableist prison system, allow that system to further marginalize them by removing their capacity for reproduction? Perhaps Sue Ahlgren’s suggestion is that they have been so victimized by society, and have endured such pain, that do not wish to have more children who will inherit that agony. Perhaps, through some morbid rationality, they have decided that it would be a cruelty to bring a child into a world that still contains people like Sue Ahlgren.</p>
<p>Perhaps.</p>
<p>But it’s also possible that I’ve misinterpreted her argument. And so I continue to look forward to hearing what Sue Ahlgren has to tell us.</p>

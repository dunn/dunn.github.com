<h2>Born Into Trouble</h2>
</header>
<p>We have long been awaiting new work from Sue Ahlgren, who rose to fame in January after publishing an exhaustively-researched article in the <em>Montecito Journal</em> arguing for the unintuitive but apparently true claim that <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/120570735/LEGALLY-BLONDE" title="Food For Too Many, page 9">poor people are lazy</a>. And she has at last delivered. In the <em>Santa Barbara Independent</em> today, Ahlgren carefully sifts through the history of <a href="http://www.ijfab.org/blog/they-all-wanted-it-done-eugenics-now-showing-in-a-state-prison-near-you/" title="IJFAB: &quot;They all wanted it done&quot;: Eugenics---Now Showing In A State Prison Near You!">eugenics in California</a>—in light of revelations that <a href="http://cironline.org/reports/female-inmates-sterilized-california-prisons-without-approval-4917" title="Center for Investigative Reporting: Female inmates sterilized in California prisons without approval">forced sterilizations have continued to be performed in prisons</a> until as recently as 2010—and concludes that somewhere around 2006 this practice ceased being a form of state-sponsored genocide against women of color and those with disabilities and instead became a responsible choice by those who finally realized that their decision to be a minority was <a href="http://www.independent.com/news/2013/jul/27/issues-not-inmates/" title="Issues, Not Inmates">reckless and unwise</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These are woman in federal prison, some with mental instability, who have accepted the counsel of health professionals in prison and decided that maybe, given their lifestyle, it would be prudent for them not to have more children. No doubt they came to the conclusion that repeated lawbreaking and incarceration is no way to raise a child.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ahlgren accordingly takes State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson to task for trying to position herself as an “advocate” for these women. Jackson, blinded by her privilege, presumes to speak for these women and erase their agency when they can speak perfectly well for themselves and have freely and happily placed themselves in the care of a prison system that has been entirely open about its mission of absolutely destroying them.</p>
<p>The only weakness of Ahlgren’s article is its terseness: her argument, against the historical consensus that forced sterilization is forced, is concise to a fault. Here it is in its entirety:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><br /> <br /> <br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The argument just quoted obviously requires some elaboration, so I will attempt to flesh out Ahlgren’s thesis.</p>
<p>Why would any person of color, or disabled person, who has a uterus, and is in a racist, sexist, and ableist prison system, allow that system to further marginalize them by removing their capacity for reproduction? Perhaps Sue Ahlgren’s suggestion is that they have been so victimized by society, and have endured such pain, that do not wish to have more children who will inherit that agony. Perhaps, through some morbid rationality, they have decided that it would be a cruelty to bring a child into a world that still contains people like Sue Ahlgren.</p>
<p>Perhaps.</p>
<p>But it’s also possible that I’ve misinterpreted her argument. And so I continue to look forward to hearing what Sue Ahlgren has to tell us.</p>

<h2>Randy Alcorn Can’t Be <em>This</em> Racist, So What’s Going On?</h2>
</header>
<p>Our <a href="wage.html" title="What Is The Point Of A Living Wage If We Are Not Truly Alive">last piece</a> examined the way local writers cleverly hide their progressive politics behind superficially reactionary claims. Harris Sherline in particular showed himself to be a master of hiding his revolutionary anti-capitalism behind boilerplate corporate rhetoric. An uncritical reader might misunderstand him, but his radical meaning was clear to those to were ready to hear it.</p>
<p>Now, however, <em>Noozhawk</em> has printed a real puzzler. Randy Alcorn has used his column to pose a curious question: “<a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/randy_alcorn_trayvon_martin_case_racism_or_reality" title="Randy Alcorn: Trayvon Martin Case---Racism or Reality?">[The] Trayvon Martin Case—Racism or Reality?</a> Such a question <em>seems</em> to imply that racism doesn’t actually exist, and that Serious People who are grounded in reality ignore the centuries-old system of oppression that continues to position Black people as second-class citizens.</p>
<p>But that can’t be what Randy is <em>actually</em> saying. There’s no way he’s <em>that</em> willfully ignorant of racism in the United States today, and of his own complicity in its perpetuation.</p>
<p>No way. So let’s dig a little deeper and see if we can figure out what he’s really getting at.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, racial profiling of black men, especially young black men, is common in America, but is it a manifestation of persistent, widespread racism? While racism certainly still exists in America, its pervasiveness is questionable. The vast majority of nonblack Americans are not racist, especially the younger generation, as Obama mentioned, for whom race is virtually a nonfactor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Randy must be trying to imply something else here, because there’s no other reason why he would utter such a blatant falsehood. Everyone raised in a racist society will more or less frequently perpetuate that racism, and because the US is still <em>profoundly</em> racist, young people are no exception. Indeed, those born after 1980 may be even <em>more</em> prone to actions that prop up racist oppression, given that they have been taught to think only of <a href="http://thegrio.com/2011/08/10/milennials-attiudes-prove-america-isnt-post-racial/" title="The Grio: Millennial attitudes prove America isn&#39;t post-racial">interpersonal <em>prejudice</em> as opposed to <em>systemic racism</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This tendency of the millennial generation to talk about racism as interpersonal rather than institutional reflects a generational divide. Completely divorced from the experiences of the Civil Rights movement, a new generation of Americans has reached adulthood without any frame of reference to provide them with a proper context, save their own limited and often lacking personal experiences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(This is the legacy of the right’s “reverse racism” talking point.)</p>
<p>Perhaps Randy’s point here about race being a “nonfactor” is that many white people have convinced themselves that we live in a “post-racial” society where they don’t need to confront their own privilege.</p>
<p>Moving along:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Racial integration throughout society is now more the norm than the exception. And mixed-race marriages only turn the disapproving heads of the nation’s most primitive cultural Neanderthals.</p>
<p>While blatant racism may explain some of the profiling and harassment of black males, especially by police, most of it stems from instinctual prejudice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is very strange, given that the country is still <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/reading-guide-segregation-in-america" title="ProPublica reading guide: Segregation in America">deeply segregated</a>, with schools possibly <em>less</em> integrated than in the 1960s. But I suppose it is indeed comforting to know that in 2010 only <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2012/02/16/the-rise-of-intermarriage/5/#chapter-4-public-attitudes-on-intermarriage" title="The Rise of Intermarriage: Public Attitudes on Intermarriage">17 percent</a> of those responding to a Pew Survey were willing to openly voice their disapproval of Blacks and whites dating, while a mere 11 percent claimed that increasing rates of intermarriage were a bad thing.</p>
<p>My guess is that Randy Alcorn here is <em>pretending</em> to be one of those commenters who points out unapologetic racist behavior as the “real” racism in order to deflect attention from their brand of <a href="http://gawker.com/5899322/the-dog-whistle-has-sounded-how-the-right-talks-about-thugs-like-trayvon-martin" title="The Dog Whistle Has Sounded: How the Right Talks About &#39;Thugs&#39; Like Trayvon Martin">dog-whistle racism that is more easily denied</a>.</p>
<p>But I’m still not sure what Randy’s ultimate purpose is. Maybe reading further will clear things up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The stark reality is that crime happens in communities of color,” New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said in a recent ABC Nightline broadcast. He went on to say, “About 70 percent to 75 percent of the people described as committing violent crimes— assault, robbery, shootings, grand larceny—are described as being African-American.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most likely Randy is citing <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/07/23/kelly_stop_and_frisk_and_muslim_surveillance_are_wonderful/" title="Kelly&#39;s creative writing: Stop-and-frisk and Muslim surveillance are wonderful!">compulsive liar Ray Kelly</a> in order to remind us both that statistics given to us by the police may exaggerate Black criminality, and that that racist police state that Ray Kelly champions may well be a major <em>cause</em> of crime in poor Black communities, by robbing young people of opportunity and hope.</p>
<p>Very good points, but I’m still not finding the thread tying this all together. Here’s Randy again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Was Martin profiled by Zimmerman? Most probably. Did Zimmerman have reason to be cautiously suspicious of Martin? Given the realities of who commits crime in America, yes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s difficult to pinpoint why Randy feels the need to repeat the lie that Black communities should be willing to take on a “racist public-safety tax” after it has been so well <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/07/the-banality-of-richard-cohen-and-racist-profiling/277871/" title="The Banality of Richard Cohen and Racist Profiling">refuted by Ta-Nehisi Coates</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New York City’s murder rate is as low as it has been in 50 years. How long should a racist public-safety tax last? Until black people no longer constitute a disproportionate share of our violent criminals, one assumes. But black people do not constitute such a group—victims of hundreds of years of racist state policy constitute that group. “Black on Black” crime is the racecraft by which the fact of what was done to us disappears, and the fact of our DNA becomes criminalized.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(In other words, “Black-on-Black” crime is the rhetorical device by which the fact that <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/07/15/the-trayvon-martin-killing-and-the-myth-of-black-on-black-crime.html" title="The Trayvon Martin Killing and the Myth of Black-on-Black Crime">violence occurs between neighbors in our segregated society</a> is transformed into an indictment of Blackness itself.)</p>
<p>I’m becoming increasingly confused, and there’s not much left of Randy’s column:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Had Zimmerman not been armed and Martin had severely beaten him, maybe killing him or leaving him disabled, would this case have commanded such ongoing national attention?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once again I must admit to being rather nonplussed by Randy’s (surely tongue-in-cheek) invocation of a racist trope. If Martin had been the aggressor rather than Zimmerman, he would have been immediately arrested and jailed, rather than allowed to walk free and only apprehended six weeks later after sustained protests. You can’t just flip the races of the attacker and victim and pretend that the sequence of events would have remained the same. To so pretend is just another method by which the effects of racism are minimized.</p>
<p>I’m thoroughly bewildered. And the last paragraph doesn’t help things:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The racism industry and the media vultures cannot bank on old white guilt forever. White America is not responsible for black behavior, black America is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can only assume that Randy is trying to write a clever parody of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/richard-cohen-racism-vs-reality/2013/07/15/4f419eb6-ed7a-11e2-a1f9-ea873b7e0424_story.html" title="Racism vs. reality">Richard Cohen’s appalling piece for the <em>Washington Post</em></a>, which he titled “Racism vs. reality”.</p>
<p>But it’s really not very funny.</p>

<h2>What Is The Point Of A Living Wage If We Are Not Truly Alive</h2>
</header>
<p>Our local writers are masters of dissimulation and double meaning. They brilliantly hide a progressive message behind overblown, reactionary rhetoric. Harry Schutle <a href="fallacy.html" title="Critical Thinking for Racists">pretended to be an ignorant racist</a> while in fact spotlighting the fallacies in racist thought. Randi Rabin <a href="friends.html" title="The Case of the Magical Magnetic Genitals">feigned interest in idiotic questions</a> so as to undermine cis- and heteronormativity. And most recently, Sharon Byrne pretended to write <a href="liberal.html" title="A New Argument for Moral Relativism">a high-school-level paper on political philosophy</a> while actually making a novel argument for moral relativism. (Byrne goes so far as to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SantaBarbaraBullshit/posts/10201690114437674?notif_t=share_wall_create" title="Lucy Sharon Byrne&#39;s post on Santa Barbara Bullshit on 20 July 2013">stay in character on Facebook</a>!)</p>
<p>But Harris Sherline has written the most subtle piece yet, an essay ostensibly concerning the living wage that is really a profound meditation on the problems at the heart of capitalism.</p>
<p>Sherline uses another article as his jumping-off point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A recent article in the <em>Washington Post</em> reporting that Washington, D.C., is considering mandating a “living wage” caught my attention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then spends over one quarter of his column quoting nearly five full paragraphs of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/wal-mart-says-it-will-pull-out-of-dc-plans-should-city-mandate-living-wage/2013/07/09/4fa7e710-e8d0-11e2-a301-ea5a8116d211_story.html" title="Wal-Mart says it will pull out of D.C. plans should city mandate &#39;living wage&#39;">the <em>Post</em> story</a>, without actually linking to the story itself. Sherline is clearly trying to make the point that <em>he</em> is not being paid enough by <em>Noozhawk</em> to write his column. And by failing to link back to the <em>Post</em> he draws attention to fact that there are no editors at <em>Noozhawk</em> who are able to catch such basic mistakes (or use block quotes where necessary).</p>
<p>After finishing his copy-and-paste protest, Sherline becomes rather pensive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve never been a fan of the “living wage” policy, which I believe causes more problems than it solves.</p>
<p>For one thing, does anyone know how much a “living wage” should be? After all, one man’s “living wage” may well be another’s poverty wage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is immediately clear that Sherline is not actually asking this question in earnest, because doing so would violate the conversational maxim of “Do Not Solemnly Ask Questions That Can Be <a href="http://livingwage.mit.edu/counties/06083" title="Living Wage Calculation for Santa Barbara County, California">Answered In Ten Seconds With Google</a>”. Rather, he is trying to make a larger point, as we can see with his next question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, just what amount of compensation is necessary to provide an adequate living, and who should make that decision? It appears that many city and county governing boards have become the decision-makers in such matters—rather than the free market.</p>
<p>Although the concept [of a living wage] has been around for a while and was adopted by the City of Santa Barbara in 2005, I have yet to see a clear statement of what it actually is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, Sherline must be tending towards something of a philosophic nature, because one is not licensed to say something like “I have yet to see such-and-such” unless such-and-such is not <a href="http://povertyinamerica.mit.edu/projects/living_wage/" title="Living Wage Project">easily accessible on the internet</a>.</p>
<p>Sherline begins to reveal his ultimate purpose when he mentions the work of the <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/rotten-acorn-ad-funded-by-anti-minimum-wage-group" title="&quot;Rotten&quot; ACORN Ad Funded by Anti-Minimum Wage Group">Employment Policies Institute</a>, a group funded by businesses for the sole purpose of lowering the minimum wage (and who, to that end, spearheaded the <a href="http://www.epionline.org/study/r113/" title="Rotten ACORN: America&#39;s Bad Seed">smear campaign</a> that helped destroy ACORN). Sherline’s purpose in citing this indefensible organization might seem puzzling at first, but it must be taken in conjunction with his earlier claim that the living wage “is nothing more than a minimum wage packaged under another label and justified as ‘economic justice’.”</p>
<p>So there we are. The living wage is a “bad idea” because it is simply another version of the minimum wage, something that has been combated so effectively by the Employment Policies Institute along with the rest of the right. Living wage laws will not ensure economic justice because there <em>cannot</em> be economic justice under a capitalist system that allows laws to be covertly influenced by corporate interests. Living wage laws are reformist approaches that merely slow the impoverishment of the lower classes while promoting a false sense of security.</p>
<p>Harris Sherline demands more than reform. He demands revolution. Join Comrade Sherline in bringing down capitalism, for only then will we have true economic justice!</p>

<h2>A New Argument for Moral Relativism</h2>
</header>
<p>Contemporary moral philosophy has hit a dead end, at least in the academy. Increasingly many students of ethics have become too willing to defer to findings in neuroscience and to experimental methods in general, often thereby confusing how we think about right and wrong with how we <em>should</em> think about right and wrong. Scanning my brain with an fMRI machine to see how I in fact react to a moral dilemma tells us nothing about how I <em>ought</em> to react.</p>
<p>Given this lamentable state of affairs, where is one to turn for new insights about morality?</p>
<p>The <em>Santa Barbara View</em>, of course.</p>
<p>Today Sharon Byrne has shaken up the field with <a href="http://www.santabarbaraview.com/defining-some-points-on-the-political-spectrum536366/" title="Defining Some Points on the Political Spectrum: Street vs Parlor Liberal vs Libertarian">a novel argument for moral relativism</a>: the view that what is morally right or wrong can vary depending on the time, place, or other aspect of the situation. Byrne—who, you will recall, <a href="home.html" title="Point-Counterpoint: Kill the Homeless, or Just Treat Them Like Animals?">does not have a PhD</a>—circumvents the insular realm of peer-reviewed journals and brings her findings direct to the people.</p>
<p>She first contrasts <em>street liberals</em>, who are often activists and are genuinely committed to eradicating oppression, with <em>parlor liberals</em>, who support leftist causes as long as it doesn’t require them to examine their own privilege and complicity in systems of inequality. She illustrates the ideological gap between these two groups with an example (unfortunately the editor of the <em>Santa Barbara View</em> accidentally exchanged instances of “parlor” and “street”; I have corrected the error):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hypothetical example: Normally tolerant [parlor] liberals get annoyed with their public spaces being taken over by homeless … They take this stance with great angst. Liberals are supposed to support the homeless, right? … So how does this play against [street] liberals’ agenda of funding homeless shelters in the [parlor] liberals’ community, and expansion of civil rights for the homeless … ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While “street liberals” recognize that the homeless deserve the same protections that the rest of us enjoy, the acknowledgment by “parlor liberals” of the humanity of others depends on whether or not the goings-on of the parlor is disrupted.</p>
<p>Byrne’s second distinction is between liberals in general and <em>libertarians</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Libertarians and liberals look alike on the surface. They both support reducing penalties [for] illegal drug use, for example.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Both also support universal healthcare, affirmative action, stronger hate-crimes legislation, and a better social safety net. They only really disagree about whether <a href="cars.html" title="The Freedom to Choose (A New or Used Automobile)">cars are basic</a>.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where they part company, as pointed out by Matt Mazza in a recent letter to the editor, is on the solution. Liberals believe government is the best regulator of human behavior.</p>
<p>Libertarians believe the opposite. The government should not be in the business of telling us what to do …</p>
</blockquote>
<figure>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/f21ZY.jpg" title="I see, yes" />
</figure>
<blockquote>
<p>Both arguments break down at various points. Liberal arguments for increased government involvement create a society in which ultimately, liberty is lost. That’s a strange outcome for a group with the Latin root <em>liberalis</em> (freedom) in its name.</p>
<p>Libertarian arguments work until you check in with, say, a cartel head. It seems we’re actually <strong>not</strong> all rational adults that should be trusted to do the right thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here Byrne sets forth the dilemma that motivates her thesis. The libertarian’s worship of individualism would restrict regulation and allow drug cartels to persist even if drugs were legalized. That is unacceptable. But the liberal’s solution, to regulate the drug trade and prevent violent cartels from flourishing, would result in an equally unacceptable loss of liberty, particularly to the cartel head. What is to be done? What is the correct solution?</p>
<p>If you’ve read your <a href="http://www.eschatonblog.com/2012/04/one-true-wanker-of-decade.html" title="THE ONE TRUE WANKER OF THE DECADE">Tom Friedman</a>, you know that the answer is somewhere in the middle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whichever paradigm you’re holding onto (and we haven’t discussed conservatives), you can safely assume that at some point it’s going to fail to provide the right answer.</p>
<p>So in my mind, it’s worth checking in with other circles to see if they’ve stumbled onto something that posits a better answer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sharon Byrne’s relativist thesis can be expressed thus: <em>for every pair of moral theories, there is a third theory that is better and is a compromise between the two.</em></p>
<p>By way of illustration, there is, according to Byrne, a compromise between liberalism and libertarianism (liberaltarianism?) that is therefore better than either. But—and this is what makes the view relativist—there is then a view that is a compromise between <em>liberaltarianism</em> and liberalism, which is better than either. There is <em>also</em> a compromise between liberaltarianism and libertarianism. And there are compromises between those compromises, and so on <em>ad infinitum</em>. No compromise is actually <em>true</em>, or even better than all others, because there are compromises of that compromise, but each is better than the views it is a compromise of.</p>
<p>This is all pretty abstract, but it’s the most explicit formulation yet of the centrist view that principles are weakness and there is always a Third Way. With Byrne’s philosophical acuity and <a href="../dn/moral.html" title="If Thomas Friedman and Matthew Yglesias Had a Child, That Child Would Be Mark Strong">Mark Strong’s youthful energy</a>, the future looks bright for bold pragmatists willing to say what everyone has already said a thousand times before.</p>

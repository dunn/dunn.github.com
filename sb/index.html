<h2>What Is The Point Of A Living Wage If We Are Not Truly Alive</h2>
</header>
<p>Our local writers are masters of dissimulation and double meaning. They brilliantly hide a progressive message behind overblown, reactionary rhetoric. Harry Schutle <a href="fallacy.html" title="Critical Thinking for Racists">pretended to be an ignorant racist</a> while in fact spotlighting the fallacies in racist thought. Randi Rabin <a href="friends.html" title="The Case of the Magical Magnetic Genitals">feigned interest in idiotic questions</a> so as to undermine cis- and heteronormativity. And most recently, Sharon Byrne pretended to write <a href="liberal.html" title="A New Argument for Moral Relativism">a high-school-level paper on political philosophy</a> while actually making a novel argument for moral relativism. (Byrne goes so far as to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SantaBarbaraBullshit/posts/10201690114437674?notif_t=share_wall_create" title="Lucy Sharon Byrne&#39;s post on Santa Barbara Bullshit on 20 July 2013">stay in character on Facebook</a>!)</p>
<p>But Harris Sherline has written the most subtle piece yet, an essay ostensibly concerning the living wage that is really a profound meditation on the problems at the heart of capitalism.</p>
<p>Sherline uses another article as his jumping-off point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A recent article in the <em>Washington Post</em> reporting that Washington, D.C., is considering mandating a “living wage” caught my attention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then spends over one quarter of his column quoting nearly five full paragraphs of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/wal-mart-says-it-will-pull-out-of-dc-plans-should-city-mandate-living-wage/2013/07/09/4fa7e710-e8d0-11e2-a301-ea5a8116d211_story.html" title="Wal-Mart says it will pull out of D.C. plans should city mandate &#39;living wage&#39;">the <em>Post</em> story</a>, without actually linking to the story itself. Sherline is clearly trying to make the point that <em>he</em> is not being paid enough by <em>Noozhawk</em> to write his column. And by failing to link back to the <em>Post</em> he draws attention to fact that there are no editors at <em>Noozhawk</em> who are able to catch such basic mistakes (or use block quotes where necessary).</p>
<p>After finishing his copy-and-paste protest, Sherline becomes rather pensive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve never been a fan of the “living wage” policy, which I believe causes more problems than it solves.</p>
<p>For one thing, does anyone know how much a “living wage” should be? After all, one man’s “living wage” may well be another’s poverty wage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is immediately clear that Sherline is not actually asking this question in earnest, because doing so would violate the conversational maxim of “Do Not Solemnly Ask Questions That Can Be <a href="http://livingwage.mit.edu/counties/06083" title="Living Wage Calculation for Santa Barbara County, California">Answered In Ten Seconds With Google</a>”. Rather, he is trying to make a larger point, as we can see with his next question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, just what amount of compensation is necessary to provide an adequate living, and who should make that decision? It appears that many city and county governing boards have become the decision-makers in such matters—rather than the free market.</p>
<p>Although the concept [of a living wage] has been around for a while and was adopted by the City of Santa Barbara in 2005, I have yet to see a clear statement of what it actually is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, Sherline must be tending towards something of a philosophic nature, because one is not licensed to say something like “I have yet to see such-and-such” unless such-and-such is not <a href="http://povertyinamerica.mit.edu/projects/living_wage/" title="Living Wage Project">easily accessible on the internet</a>.</p>
<p>Sherline begins to reveal his ultimate purpose when he mentions the work of the <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/rotten-acorn-ad-funded-by-anti-minimum-wage-group" title="&quot;Rotten&quot; ACORN Ad Funded by Anti-Minimum Wage Group">Employment Policies Institute</a>, a group funded by businesses for the sole purpose of lowering the minimum wage (and who, to that end, spearheaded the <a href="http://www.epionline.org/study/r113/" title="Rotten ACORN: America&#39;s Bad Seed">smear campaign</a> that helped destroy ACORN). Sherline’s purpose in citing this indefensible organization might seem puzzling at first, but it must be taken in conjunction with his earlier claim that the living wage “is nothing more than a minimum wage packaged under another label and justified as ‘economic justice’.”</p>
<p>So there we are. The living wage is a “bad idea” because it is simply another version of the minimum wage, something that has been combated so effectively by the Employment Policies Institute along with the rest of the right. Living wage laws will not ensure economic justice because there <em>cannot</em> be economic justice under a capitalist system that allows laws to be covertly influenced by corporate interests. Living wage laws are reformist approaches that merely slow the impoverishment of the lower classes while promoting a false sense of security.</p>
<p>Harris Sherline demands more than reform. He demands revolution. Join Comrade Sherline in bringing down capitalism, for only then will we have true economic justice!</p>

<h2>A New Argument for Moral Relativism</h2>
</header>
<p>Contemporary moral philosophy has hit a dead end, at least in the academy. Increasingly many students of ethics have become too willing to defer to findings in neuroscience and to experimental methods in general, often thereby confusing how we think about right and wrong with how we <em>should</em> think about right and wrong. Scanning my brain with an fMRI machine to see how I in fact react to a moral dilemma tells us nothing about how I <em>ought</em> to react.</p>
<p>Given this lamentable state of affairs, where is one to turn for new insights about morality?</p>
<p>The <em>Santa Barbara View</em>, of course.</p>
<p>Today Sharon Byrne has shaken up the field with <a href="http://www.santabarbaraview.com/defining-some-points-on-the-political-spectrum536366/" title="Defining Some Points on the Political Spectrum: Street vs Parlor Liberal vs Libertarian">a novel argument for moral relativism</a>: the view that what is morally right or wrong can vary depending on the time, place, or other aspect of the situation. Byrne—who, you will recall, <a href="home.html" title="Point-Counterpoint: Kill the Homeless, or Just Treat Them Like Animals?">does not have a PhD</a>—circumvents the insular realm of peer-reviewed journals and brings her findings direct to the people.</p>
<p>She first contrasts <em>street liberals</em>, who are often activists and are genuinely committed to eradicating oppression, with <em>parlor liberals</em>, who support leftist causes as long as it doesn’t require them to examine their own privilege and complicity in systems of inequality. She illustrates the ideological gap between these two groups with an example (unfortunately the editor of the <em>Santa Barbara View</em> accidentally exchanged instances of “parlor” and “street”; I have corrected the error):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hypothetical example: Normally tolerant [parlor] liberals get annoyed with their public spaces being taken over by homeless … They take this stance with great angst. Liberals are supposed to support the homeless, right? … So how does this play against [street] liberals’ agenda of funding homeless shelters in the [parlor] liberals’ community, and expansion of civil rights for the homeless … ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While “street liberals” recognize that the homeless deserve the same protections that the rest of us enjoy, the acknowledgment by “parlor liberals” of the humanity of others depends on whether or not the goings-on of the parlor is disrupted.</p>
<p>Byrne’s second distinction is between liberals in general and <em>libertarians</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Libertarians and liberals look alike on the surface. They both support reducing penalties [for] illegal drug use, for example.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Both also support universal healthcare, affirmative action, stronger hate-crimes legislation, and a better social safety net. They only really disagree about whether <a href="cars.html" title="The Freedom to Choose (A New or Used Automobile)">cars are basic</a>.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where they part company, as pointed out by Matt Mazza in a recent letter to the editor, is on the solution. Liberals believe government is the best regulator of human behavior.</p>
<p>Libertarians believe the opposite. The government should not be in the business of telling us what to do …</p>
</blockquote>
<figure>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/f21ZY.jpg" title="I see, yes" />
</figure>
<blockquote>
<p>Both arguments break down at various points. Liberal arguments for increased government involvement create a society in which ultimately, liberty is lost. That’s a strange outcome for a group with the Latin root <em>liberalis</em> (freedom) in its name.</p>
<p>Libertarian arguments work until you check in with, say, a cartel head. It seems we’re actually <strong>not</strong> all rational adults that should be trusted to do the right thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here Byrne sets forth the dilemma that motivates her thesis. The libertarian’s worship of individualism would restrict regulation and allow drug cartels to persist even if drugs were legalized. That is unacceptable. But the liberal’s solution, to regulate the drug trade and prevent violent cartels from flourishing, would result in an equally unacceptable loss of liberty, particularly to the cartel head. What is to be done? What is the correct solution?</p>
<p>If you’ve read your <a href="http://www.eschatonblog.com/2012/04/one-true-wanker-of-decade.html" title="THE ONE TRUE WANKER OF THE DECADE">Tom Friedman</a>, you know that the answer is somewhere in the middle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whichever paradigm you’re holding onto (and we haven’t discussed conservatives), you can safely assume that at some point it’s going to fail to provide the right answer.</p>
<p>So in my mind, it’s worth checking in with other circles to see if they’ve stumbled onto something that posits a better answer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sharon Byrne’s relativist thesis can be expressed thus: <em>for every pair of moral theories, there is a third theory that is better and is a compromise between the two.</em></p>
<p>By way of illustration, there is, according to Byrne, a compromise between liberalism and libertarianism (liberaltarianism?) that is therefore better than either. But—and this is what makes the view relativist—there is then a view that is a compromise between <em>liberaltarianism</em> and liberalism, which is better than either. There is <em>also</em> a compromise between liberaltarianism and libertarianism. And there are compromises between those compromises, and so on <em>ad infinitum</em>. No compromise is actually <em>true</em>, or even better than all others, because there are compromises of that compromise, but each is better than the views it is a compromise of.</p>
<p>This is all pretty abstract, but it’s the most explicit formulation yet of the centrist view that principles are weakness and there is always a Third Way. With Byrne’s philosophical acuity and <a href="../dn/moral.html" title="If Thomas Friedman and Matthew Yglesias Had a Child, That Child Would Be Mark Strong">Mark Strong’s youthful energy</a>, the future looks bright for bold pragmatists willing to say what everyone has already said a thousand times before.</p>

<h2>Why Is Paul Burri Allowed Near A Keyboard? And Other Smart Questions</h2>
</header>
<p>Local entrepreneur, inventor, columnist, engineer, guerrilla marketer and iconoclast Paul Burri is running out of ideas (<a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/112512_paul_burri_have_nothing_to_say" title="When You Have Nothing to Say">this isn’t the first time</a>). In his <em>Noozhawk</em> column, which he has apparently mistaken for a Tumblr, he’s already written about that time he <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/021013_paul_burri_the_great_frying_pan_mystery" title="Cracking the Case of the Great Frying Pan Mystery">poached an egg</a>, that time he <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/012013_paul_burri_the_electric_blanket_mix-up" title="The Electric Blanket Mix-Up Unfolds">didn’t make the bed correctly</a>, that time he went to Israel and <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/123012_paul_burri_recent_trip_to_israel" title="Observations After Our Recent Trip to Israel">decided that the Palestinians could learn a lot from the Israelis</a>, that time he got annoyed when <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/101412_paul_burri_why_didi_he_do_that" title="Questioning Why People Do the Things They Do">someone talked about him</a>, that time he <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/081912_paul_burri_words_i_think_need_to_be_invented" title="Words I Think Need to Be Invented">made up words</a>, and that time when <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/042113_paul_burri_santa_barbara_homeless" title="An Unconventional Solution to Santa Barbara’s Transient Problem">he suggested that Santa Barbara conscript people into performing manual labor and then forcibly remove them from town</a>.</p>
<p>There really isn’t much more to talk about, but <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/090212_paul_burri_man_killed_defective_toilet_seat" title="Man Killed by Defective Toilet Seat">that hasn’t stopped dear Paul before</a>. This week Paul titled his piece <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/paul_burri_dumb_questions" title="Actually, There Are Such Things as Dumb Questions">“Actually, There Are Such Things as Dumb Questions”</a>, playing on <a href="http://bitchmagazine.org/post/the-transcontinental-disability-choir-what-is-ableist-language-and-why-should-you-care" title="The Transcontinental Disability Choir: What is Ableist Language and Why Should You Care?">an ableist slur</a> to make the point that he has nothing interesting left to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whenever I am in a lecture or an adult-ed class, my hand is always one of the first to go up when we get to the Q&amp;A part of the program. And often, afterward, people frequently come up to me and thank me for asking a question they were too timid to ask. I am sure that whatever question you have on your mind, there are several others in the audience who have the same question but hesitate because it might be a “dumb question.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the risk of <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/paul_burri_whats_so_funny" title="What&#39;s So Funny?">explaining the joke</a>, this works on two levels. After having railed against the plague of “dumb” questions, it’s suddenly revealed that Paul Burri asks a lot of them himself. And the people who have to answer his questions probably can’t stop themselves from wishing he was dumb in the literal sense. But that wouldn’t stop him from typing.</p>
<p>I have nothing more to say about Paul Burri.</p>

<h2>The Case of the Magical Magnetic Genitals</h2>
</header>
<p>Randi Rabin, J. Edgar Hoover Distinguished Visiting Professor of Feelings at the Noozhawk College of Bullshit, today attempts to tackle a new version of the age old Problem of Friendship. <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/randi_rabin_help_what_happened_to_my_15_year_old_angel" title="Randi Rabin: Help! What Happened to my 15-Year-Old &#39;Angel&#39;?">This iteration, due to noted scholar <strong>Craig in Santa Barbara</strong>, runs thus</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dear Feelings Doctor:</strong> Please answer this “age old” question: Can men and women really be “just friends”? Thanks very much. I just need to know!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Craig in Santa Barbara has spent many years in the field, accosting pairs of men and women in Chaucer’s and asking them “but are you really <em>just</em> friends?” But his results have been entirely inconclusive, and he appealed to our Distinguished Professor to attempt to open up new avenues of research. (His desperate search for an answer to the question that has defined his career is evident: “I just need to know!” he says. But do you really <em>just</em> need to know, Craig?)</p>
<p>Professor Rabin’s analysis is rich and insightful. She deserves a good deal of praise for identifying “the bumpy stage of ‘should we sleep together to see if it’s great or just be friends?’” that inevitably precedes any “friendship attraction” between “women” and “guys”. She also makes the keen observation that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>society has a difficult time figuring out this whole male/female friendship thing. People seem to feel more comfortable when they know what column you go into. It makes everyone feel safer to know that you go into this box or that box. Well, guess what? Fit into a box if you like, but actually, shhh—there really is no box.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a dense bit of argumentation. For most readers, a visual aid may be necessary to clarify what’s going on:</p>
<table>
<col style="width: 18%" /><col style="width: 18%" /><tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;"><p><strong>Woman</strong></p></td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><p><strong>Man</strong></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;"><p>interacts amicably with women</p></td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><p>interacts amicably with men</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Rabin’s thesis is that these are the societal criteria by which we assign gender to individuals. If they interact amicably with women, they are a woman, and amicable interaction with men is a necessary and sufficient condition for being a man.</p>
<p>These criteria are clearly problematic, but Rabin’s criticism of them is difficult to understand at first. What are we to make of her claim that “there really is no box”? She cannot be saying merely that gender is socially constructed, for that does not make it any less real. By saying there is no box, or are no boxes, she appears to be denying the reality of gender in any sense at all.</p>
<p>Her final paragraph will only confuse the casual reader:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Besides, being best friends with the opposite sex can be an illuminating, fulfilling experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those not simply bewildered by the progression of her thoughts may accuse her of lazily conflating sex and gender, but I believe that in fact she’s making a very subtle and clever point about our society’s view of gender relations. By taking Craig from Santa Barbara’s question about the <em>gendered</em> categories of <em>woman</em> and <em>man</em> and gradually moving to a discussion of the <em>sexual</em> categories of <em>female</em> and <em>male</em>, our J. Edgar Hoover Distinguished Visiting Professor of Feelings is demonstrating how this most idiotic of questions—can men and women be friends?—can only emerge from a simplistic view of men and women as necessarily both heterosexual and cissexual. Only by (1) ignoring the existence of gay, lesbian and transgender individuals, (2) seeing sex and gender as synonymous, and (3) probably being pretty emotionally immature could anyone take that to be an open question worthy of serious discussion.</p>
<p>Rabin’s scathing piece undeniably means the end of Craig from Santa Barbara’s research program. When reached for comment, he was surprisingly upbeat, however, saying that he now has time to study where babies come from.</p>

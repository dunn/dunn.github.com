<h2>Craig Smith Is A Zombie And Should Not Be Allowed On Airplanes</h2>
</header>
<p>The release of a <a href="http://www.independent.com/news/2013/jun/26/world-war-z/" title="SB Independent: World War Z">bad movie</a> with some curious <a href="http://mattcornell.org/blog/2013/06/where-the-z-stands-for-zionism/" title="Matt Cornell: Where the Z Stands for Zionism">political undertones</a> has the the thinking public thinking again about that most <a href="https://twitter.com/adeerable/status/347688205337911296" title="Tweet from @adeerable on 20 June 2013">Serious</a> of problems: the zombie menace. As any student of anti-zombie strategy knows, the most important thing is to quickly identify and eliminate infected members of your community. Therefore I feel compelled to warn Santa Barbara residents that our own Craig Smith may be a zombie.</p>
<p>The evidence comes in the form of today’s blog post, in which <a href="http://craigsmithsblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/the-mile-high-club-needs-to-stay.html" title="The Mile High Club Needs to Stay Powered Down">he appears to admit to having “died”</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When it comes to electronic gadgets and devices, I’m a little like Charlton Heston was when it came to his gun. The only way you are going to take my iPhone away from me is to, “pry it from my cold, dead hand.” The same goes for my iPad and my Nexus 7 tablet. However, despite my attachment to these gadgets, I think the time and energy spent by the FAA on repealing the rule that electronic devices need to be powered off and put away during take-off and landing is a bad idea. The rule as it stands (“if it has an on/off switch it needs to be off) is just fine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Craig Smith will only stop using his iPhone when he is “dead”, but he <em>has</em> stopped using his phone when flying! The only possibility is that he goes into some sort of zombie fugue when boarding an airplane. What is most shocking about this revelation is the fact that he apparently recovers upon landing. Traditionally, zombies have been thought to be permanently undead. This is a disturbing development.</p>
<p>(Many of you will point out that Smith says he only dies when his phone is taken from his hands, not when it is turned off. True enough, but the implication is clear. It would be a gross non sequitur to make such a claim in the context of a discussion of the FAA’s rules for the use of electronics.)</p>
<p>A zombie on an airplane is a terrifying idea, for it allows the rapid spread of contagion. Warnings about public safety, therefore, sound pretty hollow coming from Smith:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If indeed, the most critical time on an airplane is during take-off and landing shouldn’t passengers be ready to be alerted to the possibility that an emergency is imminent? You shouldn’t be playing Angry Birds and be oblivious to the fact that everyone else is panicked because the bird you are flying on is going down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But this clumsy attempt to deflect attention from his own disease only further highlights Smith’s affliction. No passenger could be so engrossed in a game to fail to notice that their plane is crashing; but Smith, being always zombified during flight, is not aware of this. Likewise he does not realize that electronic devices are allowed to be on during the majority of the flight, proclaiming that “if they ever allow passengers to talk on cell phones during the flight, I’ll be done with flying.”</p>
<p>Let’s hope Craig Smith does stop flying, for the good of us all. In particular, though, it may make the flight attendants more comfortable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I remember a few years ago I was on a plane about to depart from JFK when a passenger was still gabbing on her cell phone even though the flight attendants were giving the safety instructions and the plane was taxiing down the runway. Apparently this passenger didn’t find the “Delta Girl” anywhere near as captivating as I do.</p>

<h2>Point-Counterpoint: Kill the Homeless, or Just Treat Them Like Animals?</h2>
</header>
<p>The most pressing question for residents of our fair city is <em>how do we get rid of the sorts of people we don’t like?</em> Finding an answer to this question is urgent due to the very large number of people we find objectionable: <a href="http://www.independent.com/news/2013/may/16/heated-debate-over-gang-injunction/" title="SB Independent: Heated Debate Over Gang Injunction">young men of color</a>, <a href="http://thebottomline.as.ucsb.edu/2013/05/violent-altercation-breaks-out-in-iv-provoked-by-homophobic-remarks" title="Violent Altercation Breaks Out in IV, Provoked By Homophobic Remarks">gender, sexual, and romantic minorities (GSRMs)</a>, and <em>especially</em> the homeless.</p>
<p>As much as we dislike people who look and love other than we do, our most righteous fury is reserved for those who—outrageously—find themselves living on the street. We therefore owe the <em>Santa Barbara View</em> our gratitude for hosting a debate on what to do with these filthy individuals who remind us, unfairly and distressingly, of the grave inequality in our society. Those who have recently taken to existing on State Street are particularly galling, given that the <em>point</em> of going to State Street is to forget about all that.</p>
<p>So something has to be done. But what?</p>
<p>Doctor Loretta Redd, PhD (she has a PhD, everyone), asks us to see the homeless population as a band of stray animals. One should not necessarily feed the strays, but rather support the shelters that are equipped to care for them. The analogy is apt: <a href="http://www.santabarbaraview.com/more-givingless-helping-santa-barbara6535387/" title="More Giving=Less Helping">“It is time to face the harm we are doing by giving money to those unable to use it wisely,”</a>, writes Redd (who has a PhD), making the obvious but often-overlooked point that a house or apartment is a precondition of rationality. She suggests that instead of feeding these anthropomorphized seagulls, we</p>
<blockquote>
<p>follow the Atlanta model, and <strong>install “giving meters”</strong> on sidewalks, or on private property if owners are willing, where the money could be collected and transferred to programs of transitional housing or intensive professional service to assist those addicted to substances.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An interesting proposal, but not one that is to the liking of Dr. Redd’s sparring partner in this online debate. Sharon Byrne (who does <em>not</em>, apparently, have a PhD), argues that <a href="http://www.santabarbaraview.com/the-business-of-homelessness-in-santa-barbara/" title="The Business of Homelessness in Santa Barbara, California">shelters like Casa Esperanza have existed for a number of years and continue to pay their employees</a>, proof of their profound corruption. Moreover,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For all the money that has been spent, is still being spent, and what it’s being spent on …</p>
<p>How well is the city really tackling this issue?</p>
<p>Could it be done better?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are, of course, rhetorical questions, since we know that <a href="http://www.santabarbaraview.com/whose-city-is-it-anyway2542252/" title="Whose City Is It, Anyway?">truly helping other people is tree-hugger bullshit</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Some suggest that we] <strong>stop Wall St Greed, and end the disparity between rich and poor to solve homelessness.</strong> Sure, we’ll get right on that. No one’s solved it in decades, but let Santa Barbara lead the charge!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in any case, Sharon Byrne has done extensive research and discovered that “the bench occupiers [on State Street] aren’t homeless.” (She has not released the data supporting this claim, presumably because she plans on publishing her findings and is afraid of academic plagiarism. Understandable.)</p>
<p>What, then, is Byrne’s suggestion? How are we do deal with this plague of undesirables? She, unfortunately, has no answers, but recognizes that this question is of <a href="http://www.santabarbaraview.com/whose-city-is-it-anyway2542252/" title="Whose City Is It, Anyway?">existential import</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whose city is it, anyway???</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If homeless youths are allowed to remain in Santa Barbara, Sharon Byrne is gone. Much as in the pitiful case of <a href="http://www.independent.com/news/2013/jun/14/sidewalk-weapons/" title="Terrorists on Wheels">a woman driven out of town by terrorists</a>, it is perfectly clear who we would rather have living in our city.</p>

<h2>Critical Thinking for Racists</h2>
</header>
<p>One of the most important aspects of teaching is the use of apt examples to illustrate key points. If an educator fails to show how a subject is applicable to real problems, students may find it abstract, pointless, and unworthy of their attention.</p>
<p>It is particularly crucial to remember this when discussing <em>fallacies</em>. We commit fallacies—errors in reasoning—on a daily basis, but studying them in the context of <em>logic</em> or <em>critical thinking</em> can lead to one’s pupils treating them as academic issues, rather than faults which can negatively affect many aspects of our lives. It is very fortunate, therefore, that <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/061713_henry_schulte_immigration_reform/" title="Noozhawk: If We Would Use the Process Already in Place, We Wouldn&#39;t Need Immigration &#39;Reform&#39;">Henry Schulte has taken to the pages of today’s <em>Noozhawk</em></a> to demonstrate vividly how we frequently commit fallacies in our ordinary thinking.</p>
<p>Schulte draws his examples from a fictional polemic against immigration reform. His fictional author, railing against the imagined evils brought about by undocumented immigration, makes an illustrative series of fallacies that are highly instructive.</p>
<p>First Schulte addresses the <a href="http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/appeal-to-ridicule.html" title="The Nizkor Project: Appeal to Ridicule"><em>appeal to ridicule</em></a>. His op-ed writer tells a story about moving to China on a visa and remaining there for 20 years, presumably against Chinese law. When his undocumented status is discovered, he is arrested. He sarcastically <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/061713_henry_schulte_immigration_reform/" title="Noozhawk: If We Would Use the Process Already in Place, We Wouldn&#39;t Need Immigration &#39;Reform&#39;">laments his plight</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I don’t get is after all these years of living and working there, how come I couldn’t get a bunch of free stuff and become a Chinese citizen?</p>
<p>Sound ridiculous? It is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By treating healthcare, security, voting rights, and other benefits of citizenship as “free stuff”, the (invented) opinion writer trivializes the often life-saving rights conferred to citizens and denied to others in a cynical attempt to convince readers to ignore their importance and instead think of the less-privileged as <a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/14/romney-blames-loss-on-obamas-gifts-to-minorities-and-young-voters/" title="Romney Blames Loss on Obama&#39;s &#39;Gifts&#39; to Minorities and Young Voters">moochers looking for gifts</a>.</p>
<p>It’s of course <em>not</em> ridiculous to think that a person who has lived somewhere for two decades and become part of that society has some claim to stay, but Schulte shows here how the impression that it <em>is</em> can be easily produced in an incautious mind.</p>
<p>The next example is not of a fallacy, strictly speaking, but it is noteworthy all the same:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We already have a process [for immigration] in place that has been working just fine for those who follow the law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is simply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Bullshit" title="Wikipedia: On Bullshit">bullshit</a>. The claim that the existing immigration system is perfectly functional is <a href="http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/04/12/17709883-waiting-half-a-life-for-a-green-card-families-languish-in-immigration-line?lite" title="Waiting half a life for a green card: Families languish in immigration line">obviously false</a>, but our devious (and thankfully nonexistent) author presents this claim with such confidence that some readers may take it as fact. Those who see through it will likely treat the rest of the article with skepticism, so this sort of flagrant bullshitting is a risky strategy.</p>
<p>Schulte next provides two passages that exemplify the <a href="http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/straw-man.html" title="Nizkor Project: Straw Man"><em>straw man fallacy</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The left has hammered us for so long with the need for immigration reform that it’s made many believe it’s now a requirement. And they try to guilt those who are opposed as racist and cold-hearted who don’t care about the lives of other people. What about the lives and welfare of American citizens?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>…</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The debate isn’t over whether immigrants work hard or contribute something to the American society; it’s how come we’re being forced to change our policy to accommodate one group over another.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here our delusional author (the product of a truly creative mind) combines another bit of bullshit—the outrageous claim that <em>white Americans are being oppressed</em> by undocumented immigrants—with a gross distortion of the position held by those who advocate immigration reform. Comprehensive reform—even the sort of idealistic reform that would allow free movement across borders—is not an attempt to “accommodate” one group over another. Nor do those who seek such reform care more about immigrants than citizens. Reform activists care about the welfare of <em>all</em> people, and loathe discriminatory policies (such as ours) that treat immigrants and non-citizens as second-class.</p>
<p>Next we get what I’ll call the <em>fallacy of ambiguity</em>. Our imaginary writer has turned to the invented problem known as “Who Will Pay For All These Lazy Immigrants?” He claims that they will not themselves contribute via taxes, because <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/061713_henry_schulte_immigration_reform/" title="Noozhawk: If We Would Use the Process Already in Place, We Wouldn&#39;t Need Immigration &#39;Reform&#39;">“already half the country doesn’t pay a dime as it is.”</a></p>
<p>What is true is that <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/18/mitt-romney/romney-says-47-percent-americans-pay-no-income-tax/" title="Politifact: Mitt Romney says 47 percent of Americans pay no income tax">about half of US citizens do not pay <em>income</em> tax</a>; but most of these individuals still pay sales taxes, property taxes, Social Security taxes, and other non-income taxes. Schulte’s fake demagogue intends for readers to understand him to be referring to <em>all</em> taxes, when his statement is only anything close to true if he is taken to be talking about only the income tax.</p>
<p>Next he bemoans the supposedly uncivilized nature of immigrants, exposing us in the process to the <a href="http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/spotlight.html" title="Nizkor Project: Spotlight"><em>spotlight fallacy</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And keep in mind there is a vast segment of these immigrants responsible for domestic violence, gangs, drugs, drunken driving and human smuggling. You only need to read the paper to see the result of this everyday. This isn’t racist, it’s factual.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Regrettably, for the hardworking portion of immigrants this bad element taints the entire group, but in the end we all suffer for it and it’s only getting worse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mainstream media traffics in sensationalism and race-baiting, so it is thoroughly unsurprising that stories involving crime, especially crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, receive a great deal of coverage. But it is obviously fallacious to take that unbalanced coverage and use it to make a gross generalization about immigrants as a group.</p>
<p>This fallacy is followed by a series of bold rhetorical moves. Our imaginary polemicist recognizes that his characterization of immigrants will be seen as a cheap bit of racist fear-mongering, so:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>He insists that his racist claims are in fact just factual descriptions of how the world is. This move was performed most audaciously by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bell_Curve" title="Wikipedia: The Bell Curve">Herrnstein and Murray</a>, and has recently come to the public consciousness again thanks to Heroic Freethinker <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/05/08/heritage-study-co-author-opposed-letting-in-immigrants-with-low-iqs/" title="Heritage study co-author opposed letting in immigrants with low IQs">Jason Richwine</a>. Of course, this is just more bullshit.</p></li>
<li><p>He <em>actually admits</em> that he’s making an unfair (and racist) generalization about a class of individuals, but—regrettably!—insists that it’s justified to do so. It’s a truly breathtaking maneuver.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Our last fallacy is some twisted variation on the <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/at/sunk_cost_fallacy/" title="LessWrong: Sunk Cost Fallacy"><em>sunk cost fallacy</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And how is this [immigration reform] fair for all those who have struggled through the legal process, waited years and spent thousands of dollars to do it the right way? For one thing, it diminishes their pride in becoming an American citizen after all their hard efforts. They would have to ask themselves why they bothered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exactly! It wouldn’t be fair to the <em>other immigrants</em>, who had the time and resources to navigate the nightmarish immigration process, if all of a sudden it was made easier for <em>everyone</em> to cross borders. They spent thousands of dollars and waited decades to come to the United States, and now other people don’t have to? Why even bother coming after all?</p>
<p>Because in the world of Harry Schulte, you’re only doing well if someone else is doing much, much worse.</p>

<h2>A Small Business Success (Take That, Obama!)</h2>
</header>
<p>Life has not been easy for small business owners of the Caucasian persuasion since Black Spy Barack Hussein Obama passed the Reparations Act of Reverse Racism (RARR!). Good, hardworking Americans have found their already-shrinking incomes further taxed to pay for the data plans of Obamaphones, which are then used by Welfare-Americans to shop online and put local stores out of business. Just such a fate recently befell area White man Jan Koch (relationship to the Koch brothers unknown), whose Travel Store is <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/travel_store_closes_doors_after_29_years/" title="Travel Store of Santa Barbara Packing It In After 29 Years">closing its doors this month</a>.</p>
<p>But despite the increasingly dystopian nature of the country as it slides toward an inevitable race war, some hero entrepreneurs have refused to take the easy way out (food stamps) and have valiantly started a profitable business despite the best efforts of the Obama regime. Success has not come easily for <a href="http://sbmag.com/2013/06/15556/" title="Santa Barbara Magazine: Jet Set">David and Healey Young</a>, who live a Spartan existence while their pour all their resources into staying afloat.</p>
<figure>
<img src="http://sbmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-shot-2013-06-14-at-11.19.33-AM.png" title="Screen-shot-2013-06-14-at-11.19.33-AM.png" alt="The Youngs in their sparsely-furnished home, from Santa Barbara Magazine" /><figcaption>The Youngs in their sparsely-furnished home, <a href="http://sbmag.com/2013/06/15556/" title="Santa Barbara Magazine: Jet Set">from Santa Barbara Magazine</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The severe difficulties that the Youngs have faced have given them a humble, grounded perspective on life. Says Healey:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I love classics toughened up with edgy pieces. I’ll pair a checkered oxford with a pouf skirt and insanely high ankle-risking Lanvin wedges. I love L.A. designer Gladys Tamez’s hats. And vintage pool dresses when they’re least expected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>David is equally modest, admitting only with embarrassment that “I discovered the Santa Barbara-band Dishwalla, so I have a gold record for their first album <em>Pet Your Friends</em>.” He also makes a self-conscious reference to his signed poster of Green Day’s <em>American Idiot</em>. It is rumored that the album name is in fact a reference to David Young.</p>
<p>The vocation that the Youngs have sacrificed everything for is a thankless one. They run a private “jet charter service”—a misleading title for a business that is little more than an air taxi operator. David and Healey fly the planes themselves, and are continually at the mercy of <a href="http://popdust.com/2012/11/19/rihanna-air-naked-in-the-aisles/" title="Pop Dust: Air Rihanna: Nudity, Talk of Mutiny and the Smell of Hot Processed Cheese and Fear">Obama’s nouveau rich</a>. Often they are treated as glorified UPS drivers; David recalls the humiliation he felt when he “flew a tuxedo to its owner on a Citation X, the world’s fastest civilian jet.”</p>
<p>For all their suffering, the two refuse to go into detail about the debauched behavior of their passengers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What happens at 40,000 feet stays at 40,000 feet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But their reticence may only be due to the fact that their livelihood is continually at risk—one disgruntled call from an Obamaphone could put them on the streets.</p>

<h2>The Freedom to Choose (A New or Used Automobile)</h2>
</header>
<p>In contemporary philosophy it often seems as if <a href="https://twitter.com/possibleviews" title="@possibleviews on Twitter">all possible views</a> have been formulated and defended. It’s been argued that only the present exists, that the past <em>and</em> future exist (and thus that dinosaurs and future people exist too), that Sherlock Holmes really exists, and that <em>we</em> don’t exist. One Christian philosopher has even suggested that when we die, God exchanges our corpse with a perfect copy; the copy decomposes in the earth but we remain intact, to allow for reincarnation.</p>
<p>But despite this plurality of bizarre opinions, there is a reasonable amount of consensus on certain issues related to material things and their parts. Everyday objects like tables, chairs, cars, and televisions are generally agreed to be built up out of parts: I can disassemble a car into its tires, engine, doors, etc. In that sense, the car exists because its parts are put together in the right way; if they are not assembled correctly, there is no car. The car is not <em>basic</em>.</p>
<p>Noticing this unusual consensus, a certain <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS5__yFW5EE" title="CARSAREBASIC Interview 1OF4">Scott Wenz</a> has boldly staked out an opposing view in pursuit of fame and articles that might get accepted for publication in <em>The Philosophical Quarterly</em>. He has recently made the exciting claim that <strong>cars <em>are</em> basic</strong>.</p>
<p>Extraordinary!</p>
<p>Perhaps believing that his radical ideas will not be received warmly by the philosophical establishment, Wenz has—like <a href="https://chronicle.com/blogs/percolator/the-strangest-conference-i-ever-attended/32805" title="The Strangest Conference I Ever Attended">David Birnbaum</a>—sought to advance his theory outside the confines of academia. He has even started <a href="http://www.carsarebasic.org/" title="Cars Are Basic">his own nonprofit</a> in order to better reach a receptive audience.</p>
<p>Scott Wenz’s theory is complicated and highly abstract, but he has made admirable efforts to explain the essential points in <a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/letter_to_the_editor_high-speed_rail_bart_and_santa_barbara_connected/" title="Letter to the Editor: High-Speed Rail, BART and Santa Barbara Connected?">clear, straightforward language</a>. He begins his précis by explaining why such things as the <a href="http://www.bart.gov/">Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART)</a>, high-speed rail, and buses are <em>not</em> basic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[1] An Associated Press article printed Monday states that BART General Manager Dorothy Dugger resigned under presser [sic] in May 2011, but collected $330,000 in pay and additional benefits that included two added months of vacation!</p>
<p>BART is part of the heavily subsidized and expensive commuter rail system that has failed in the San Jose area and has questionable ridership outside of the San Francisco Bay.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>…</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[2] The connection to an extravagant and unneeded high-speed rail project is the initial billion-dollar bond recently approved to build “stupid is as stupid does rail.” A good portion will be spent not on the rail but multimillion-dollar spinoffs for inefficient BART and projects not related to the bullet train.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>…</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[3] Santa Barbara MTD under similar type management problems in the past decade has seen most of its board resign for lousy decisions, and MTD’s director forced out. Remember the “all electric bus” that failed to meet freeway specifications, fuel efficiency (batteries), violated federal contract provisions, etc.? What did the South County cities do? Appointed new board members who gave the disgraced MTD director a golden parachute, approving more routes that are badly used, and don’t forget the failed (and expensive) long-distance commuter buses to Santa Ynez and Lompoc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The main thrust of Wenz’s theory is starting to emerge. Trains and buses (and bikes!) are not basic because their usability requires government support. The operation of trains and buses and the infrastructure required for bicycles must be provided by the government. But the government is inherently corrupt, so these non-basic forms of transportation are inherently flawed and should not be funded. (There was literally <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120715031917/http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-rail-advice-20120709,0,973921,full.story" title="LA Times: High-speed rail officials rebuffed proposal from French railway">nothing California could have done</a> to make high-speed rail work.)</p>
<p>Cars, on the other hand, <em>are</em> basic, according to Wenz. My use of a car does not depend on the government in any way. I purchase a car from a private dealer, I <em>certainly</em> do not register it, I siphon gas rather than pay the gas tax, and I drive it wherever I choose. It is that <em>freedom</em> provided by cars that <a href="http://www.carsarebasic.org/mission.html" title="Mission Statement for Cars Are Basic">makes them basic</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The right to <strong><em>choose</em></strong> the mode of transportation is at the core of a free society. Designing and maintaining <strong><em>core routes</em></strong> with capacity to efficiently handle vehicles, allowing for safe and flexible personal transportation decisions is essential.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Freedom to choose. In a free society, everyone is able to choose how they travel: by Ford, Honda, Toyota, or any of the many fine brands of automobile that truly <em>anyone</em> can afford. The criterion of liberty is having this <em>personal transportation decision</em>—and what more could one want?</p>

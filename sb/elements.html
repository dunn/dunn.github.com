<blockquote>
<p>You are searching for something. We all are.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Your repressed instincts call out for expression.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Gathering. Fire. Basketry. Dance. The Hunt. Drumming. Tribe.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Who you are is the culmination of millions of years of being shaped by the land and sea … and you are here now because you lived as a tribe.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As your instincts are awakened, you feel alive! And yet … you can neither return completely to the Stone Age nor move forward along the path of modern society.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The world is changing. Modern knowledge without wisdom has pitted us against one another and the earth that sustains us.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We need a new paradigm. It is happening now.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Our new paradigm is expansive … embracing the fullness of what it is to be human … pushing the far edges of our instincts, our capacity to love, the depth of our feelings, our ego and Oneness, the sharpness of intellect and the formlessness of deepest connection. It is honest and courageous, promoting beauty and harmony. It dances and sings and shouts and holds a knife in one hand and a lily in the other … with an iPhone5 in a pocket.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ancient wisdom guides modern innovation. The desire to blend with others and be in harmony merges with the desire to alter, judge and dominate.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We are defining the new paradigm. Together.</p>

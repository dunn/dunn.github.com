<p>*This is the first (and, hopefully, last) installment of <em>Art Critic</em>, in which we attempt a negative definition of art by excluding everything produced in Santa Barbara.*</p>
<hr />
<p>Steve Greenberg is widely thought to be a cartoonist, but there has historically been little evidence supporting that claim. This week, however, the <em>Santa Barbara View</em> threw their weight behind the credibility of rumors that Greenberg in fact draws pictures, accompanied with text, that aim to provide humorous commentary on current political affairs. By reprinting his piece “<a href="http://www.greenberg-art.com/.Toons/.Toons%20recent/HousingBubble.html">Housing Bubble 2</a>”, which first appeared in the <em>Ventura Star</em> last month, the suggestion is that the work meets enough of the criteria listed above to be considered a “political cartoon”.</p>

<h2>Essay: <a href="docs/horse.html">Leading a horse</a></h2>
</header>
<p>I don’t really know why all of a sudden I’m so cut up about <span class="citation" data-cites="Horse">@Horse</span>_ebooks <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/24/the-human-behind-a-favorite-spambot-horse_ebooks/" title="Jenna Wortham: The Human Behind a Favorite Spambot, Horse_eBooks">not being real</a>. (Yes, in this context a spambot algorithm is real while a person isn’t.) When I first read Dan Sinker’s <a href="http://dansinker.com/post/62183207705/eulogy-for-a-horse">Eulogy for a horse</a> I thought it was a bit over-dramatic, but then I started talking about the whole affair with other people and their grief seeped into me or something and now I’m actually pretty upset about a spambot account on Twitter turning out to be something other than a spambot.</p>

<h2>Essay: <a href="docs/dudebros.html">Dudebros as a sublime expression of the absurd, or: proving Shanley’s point without realizing it</a></h2>
</header>
<p>On September 3, Shanley Kane wrote a <a href="https://medium.com/about-work/82978662b2d6" title="Things I Never, Ever Want to Hear Again">fantastic piece</a> on the “predictable litany of false martyrdom, victim-blaming, self-involved demands for ‘education’, endless derailing techniques paraded as ‘logic’, disingenuous bewilderment, unjustifiable confidence, and totally unexamined privilege” experienced by women who write about sexism in tech.</p>
<p>And what did she get in response? Nothing less than a predictable litany of false martyrdom, victim-blaming, self-involved demands for “education”, endless derailing techniques paraded as “logic”, disingenuous bewilderment, unjustifiable confidence, and totally unexamined privilege.</p>
<p>I picked out some of the tweets that, while apparently sincere attempts to disagree with Shanley, most clearly made her point for her.</p>

<h2>Essay: <a href="docs/tc.html">The Problem with <em>Thought Catalog</em></a></h2>
</header>
<p>Last week, <a href="http://thoughtcatalog.com"><em>Thought Catalog</em></a> published an essay—ostensibly about a woman’s relationship with her boyfriend—that was full of anti-trans sentiments. A number of excellent replies were written, some also published on Thought Catalog, and we all hoped something had been learned. But today Thought Catalog pushed out an article by Jim Goad that was transphobic, racist, sexist, and pretty much exactly what you’d expect from one of the worst people on the internet.</p>
<p>The kicker is that this is Goad’s <em>sixth</em> piece for <em>Thought Catalog</em>. This is a problem.</p>

</header>
<p>Santa Barbara is full of Serious People with Serious Problems. If they aren’t heroically defending the city’s Mediterranean architecture, or battling against City Council’s perpetual War on Cars, they are fretting about the lack of civility shown by today’s youths and marvelling at the impudence of the homeless population’s continued existence.</p>
<p><em>Santa Barbara Bullshit</em> treats all these concerns with the deadly earnestness they deserve.</p>

<p>Much is made in <em>Harry Potter</em> about “the Trace”, the charm on underage witches and wizards that is used by the Ministry to detect illegal spellwork. The problem is that there is no such thing.</p>

<h2>Essay: <a href="docs/jahar.html">Of <em>Course</em> There’s Erotic Fan Fiction About Dzokhar Tsarnaev</a></h2>
</header>
<p>Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (nicknamed “Jahar”) is very attractive to the teenage Tumblr crowd, so they <em>want</em> him to be innocent, and will buy the silliest theories that confirm what they want to believe.</p>
<p>With this in mind it’s <em>obvious</em> that someone would write erotic fan fiction about Jahar. I still can’t believe it took <a href="https://twitter.com/DuncanIdunno/status/331234768211542017" title="Tweet by @duncanidunno on 5 May 2013">this</a> to make me realize that, <em>of course there’s erotic fan fiction about Jahar</em>.</p>
<p>Of course there is.</p>

<p>I am delighted to announce the launch of <em>The Daily Nonsense</em>, the only campus publication at UCSB with any moral compass at all.

<h2>Essay: <a href="http://baruffio.com/docs/lucidity.html" title="When You&#39;re Lucid Dreaming You Can Do Anything But That Includes Being Racist">Cultural Appropriation at Lucidity</a></h2>
</header>
<p>Santa Barbara-based <a href="http://lucidityfestival.com/" title="Lucidity Festival website">Lucidity Festival</a> has a problem with cultural appropriation. Unfortunately, the organizers don’t seem to have a firm grasp on what ‘cultural appropriation’ means, and so they don’t see what the big deal is or why they should make changes to their festival.</p>

<h2>Essay: <a href="http://baruffio.com/docs/expelliarmus.html">The complete guide to wand ownership in <em>Harry Potter</em></a></h2>
</header>
<p>Until <em>Deathly Hallows</em>, we all thought <em>Expelliarmus</em> was just a nifty spell that causes people to drop their wands and sometimes knocks them over (which is why we had all those Tower Truthers saying that <a href="http://www.beyondhogwarts.com/harry-potter/articles/dumbledore-clues.html" title="Beyond Hogwarts">Dumbledore wasn’t dead</a>). But then it turns out that it’s <em>totally bonkers</em>. Apparently disarming someone actually <em>transfers their wand’s loyalty to you</em>.</p>
<p>This is totally bonkers because <em>everybody disarms everybody</em> at some point. So to figure out whose wand is whose and what <em>really</em> happened, let’s catalog every instance of disarming ever!</p>

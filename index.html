<h2>Project: <a href="sb/index.html"><em>Santa Barbara Bullshit</em></a></h2>
</header>
<p>Santa Barbara is full of Serious People with Serious Problems. If they aren’t heroically defending the city’s Mediterranean architecture, or battling against City Council’s perpetual War on Cars, they are fretting about the lack of civility shown by today’s youths and marvelling at the impudence of the homeless population’s continued existence.</p>
<p><em>Santa Barbara Bullshit</em> treats all these concerns with the deadly earnestness they deserve.</p>

<h2>Essay: <a href="docs/trace.html">There's No Such Thing as the Trace in <em>Harry Potter</em></a></h2>
</header>
<p>Much is made in <em>Harry Potter</em> about “the Trace”, the charm on underage witches and wizards that is used by the Ministry to detect illegal spellwork. The problem is that there is no such thing.</p>

<h2>Essay: <a href="docs/jahar.html">Of <em>Course</em> There’s Erotic Fan Fiction About Dzokhar Tsarnaev</a></h2>
</header>
<p>Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (nicknamed “Jahar”) is very attractive to the teenage Tumblr crowd, so they <em>want</em> him to be innocent, and will buy the silliest theories that confirm what they want to believe.</p>
<p>With this in mind it’s <em>obvious</em> that someone would write erotic fan fiction about Jahar. I still can’t believe it took <a href="https://twitter.com/DuncanIdunno/status/331234768211542017" title="Tweet by @duncanidunno on 5 May 2013">this</a> to make me realize that, <em>of course there’s erotic fan fiction about Jahar</em>.</p>
<p>Of course there is.</p>

<h2>Project: <a href="dn/index.html"><em>The Daily Nonsense</em></a></h2>
</header>
<p>I am delighted to announce the launch of <em>The Daily Nonsense</em>, the only campus publication at UCSB with any moral compass at all. Upon learning of our existence, a group of campus Republicans went back in time and started something called <a href="http://dailynexus.com/" title="WARNING WARNING FAKE SITE">“The Daily Nexus”</a> in an attempt to undermine our credibility. Support the <em>Nonsense</em> and recognize the <em>Nexus</em> for the cabal of hacks they are!</p>
<p>(Please direct all complaints to <a href="https://twitter.com/thedailynexus">our social media intern</a>.)</p>

<h2>Essay: <a href="http://baruffio.com/docs/lucidity.html" title="When You&#39;re Lucid Dreaming You Can Do Anything But That Includes Being Racist">Cultural Appropriation at Lucidity</a></h2>
</header>
<p>Santa Barbara-based <a href="http://lucidityfestival.com/" title="Lucidity Festival website">Lucidity Festival</a> has a problem with cultural appropriation. Unfortunately, the organizers don’t seem to have a firm grasp on what ‘cultural appropriation’ means, and so they don’t see what the big deal is or why they should make changes to their festival.</p>

<h2>Essay: <a href="http://baruffio.com/docs/expelliarmus.html">The complete guide to wand ownership in <em>Harry Potter</em></a></h2>
</header>
<p>Until <em>Deathly Hallows</em>, we all thought <em>Expelliarmus</em> was just a nifty spell that causes people to drop their wands and sometimes knocks them over (which is why we had all those Tower Truthers saying that <a href="http://www.beyondhogwarts.com/harry-potter/articles/dumbledore-clues.html" title="Beyond Hogwarts">Dumbledore wasn’t dead</a>). But then it turns out that it’s <em>totally bonkers</em>. Apparently disarming someone actually <em>transfers their wand’s loyalty to you</em>.</p>
<p>This is totally bonkers because <em>everybody disarms everybody</em> at some point. So to figure out whose wand is whose and what <em>really</em> happened, let’s catalog every instance of disarming ever!</p>

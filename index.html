<h2>Essay: <a href="docs/ronbledore/index.html">You Can’t Spell OTP without <em>OotP</em>: An Essay in Ronbledore Apologetics</a></h2>
</header>
<p>Earlier this month, J.K. Rowling finally admitted that Ron and Hermione should not have ended up together. While this led us to ponder what <a href="https://twitter.com/dunndunndunn/status/429878749941596161">alternate endings</a> Rowling might have secretly preferred, it offered powerful support for the once-maligned <a href="http://the-toast.net/2014/02/03/regret-pairing-ron-hermione-together-ron-time-traveling-dumbledore-jk-rowling-admits/">Ronbledore Theory</a>, which maintains that Ron <em>is</em> Dumbledore, and at some point went back in time to live the majority of his life as the eldest son of Percival and Kendra Dumbledore.</p>
<p>The truth of the Ronbledore Theory has by now been pretty well established, but I would like to shore up its foundations with some new evidence, evidence that will help explain <em>why</em> Ronbledore went back in time, as well as—roughly—<em>when</em>.</p>

<h2>Essay: <a href="docs/unplottable.html">‘Unplottable’ is Unpossible</a></h2>
</header>
<p>In <em>Harry Potter</em>, places like Hogwarts are hidden from unwelcome eyes with a number of protective enchantments. One of these enchantments makes the building <em>unplottable</em>, and so — apparently — incapable of being plotted on a map.</p>
<p>This may seem impossible, and when we think through it carefully we’ll see that it basically is. A coherent notion of <em>unplottability</em> cannot not say anything about what I can and can’t draw on a piece of paper. Witches and wizards might, however, try to stop people from <em>learning</em> the location of Hogwarts from that piece of paper — the information can be <em>encoded</em>, but it may be possible with magic to prevent it from being <em>transmitted</em>.</p>
<p>But ultimately this won’t be enough to prevent us from using maps to find Hogwarts. Unplottability is a scam that doesn’t really work.</p>

<h2>Essay: <a href="docs/trace.html">There’s No Such Thing as the Trace in <em>Harry Potter</em></a></h2>
</header>
<p>Much is made in <em>Harry Potter</em> about “the Trace”, the charm on underage witches and wizards that is used by the Ministry to detect illegal spellwork. The problem is that there is no such thing.</p>

<h2>Essay: <a href="http://baruffio.com/docs/expelliarmus.html">The complete guide to wand ownership in <em>Harry Potter</em></a></h2>
</header>
<p>Until <em>Deathly Hallows</em>, we all thought <em>Expelliarmus</em> was just a nifty spell that causes people to drop their wands and sometimes knocks them over (which is why we had all those Tower Truthers saying that <a href="http://www.beyondhogwarts.com/harry-potter/articles/dumbledore-clues.html" title="Beyond Hogwarts">Dumbledore wasn’t dead</a>). But then it turns out that it’s <em>totally bonkers</em>. Apparently disarming someone actually <em>transfers their wand’s loyalty to you</em>.</p>
<p>This is totally bonkers because <em>everybody disarms everybody</em> at some point. So to figure out whose wand is whose and what <em>really</em> happened, let’s catalog every instance of disarming ever!</p>

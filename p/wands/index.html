It&#8217;s where you can read ludicrously in-depth analyses of a single spell. It&#8217;s where the only argument against a conspiracy theory is that it&#8217;s not consistent. It&#8217;s where we&#8217;re still talking about <em>Harry Potter,</em> after all these years. </p> <h2><em>&#8220;Point me!&#8221;</em></h2> <p>Everything we&#8217;ve published is in <a href="/p" title="Baruffio archive">the Pensieve</a>.</p> <p>You can follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/baruffio_txt">Twitter</a> and subscribe to our <a href="/index.xml" title="Main RSS">RSS feed</a>.</p> </section> </div> <section id="content-start" class="primary single"> <p>Until <em>Deathly Hallows</em>, we all thought <em>Expelliarmus</em> was just a nifty spell that causes people to drop their wands and sometimes knocks them over (which is why we had all those Tower Truthers saying that <a href="http://www.beyondhogwarts.com/harry-potter/articles/dumbledore-clues.html" title="Beyond Hogwarts">Dumbledore wasn&rsquo;t dead</a>). But then it turns out that it&rsquo;s <em>totally bonkers</em>. Apparently disarming someone actually <em>transfers their wand&rsquo;s loyalty to you</em>.</p> <p>This is totally bonkers because <em>everybody disarms everybody</em> at some point. So to figure out whose wand is whose and what <em>really</em> happened, let&rsquo;s catalog every instance of disarming ever!</p> <p>Before we do that, though, we need to figure out when exactly a wand changes owners.</p> <p>Well, maybe not <em>exactly.</em></p> <h2 id="toc_0">How <em>Expelliarmus</em> works (maybe)</h2> <p>For some reason Harry has to finish He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named in the <em>very same way</em> that he beats You-Know-Who when he&rsquo;s only a baby; namely, by having Lord Thingy&rsquo;s <em>Avada Kedavra</em> bounce off the Chosen Boy like he&rsquo;s some sort of magic mirror. In order to pull it off, Rowling drops this tidbit on us two-thirds of the way through <em>Deathly Hallows</em>:</p> <blockquote> <p>&ldquo;Hawthorn and unicorn hair. Ten inches precisely. Reasonably springy. This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;Was?&rdquo; repeated Harry. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it still his?&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;Perhaps not. If you took it&mdash;&rdquo;</p> <p>&rdquo;&mdash;I did&mdash;&rdquo;</p> <p>&rdquo;&mdash;then it may be yours. Of course, the manner of taking matters.&rdquo;</p> <p>&hellip;</p> <p>&ldquo;I took this wand from Draco Malfoy by force,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;Can I use it safely?&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;I think so. Subtle laws govern wand ownership, but the conquered wand will usually bend its will to its new master&rdquo; (<em>DH,</em> chapter 24).</p> </blockquote> <p>If you&rsquo;re prone to fits of charitability, you might think that all this means is that, when you disarm someone else by force and take their wand, <em>eventually</em> the wand <em>might</em> &ldquo;bend its will&rdquo; to you.</p> <p>But you would be wrong! Check out this exchange from Harry&rsquo;s rap battle with Voldy:</p> <blockquote> <p>&ldquo;You still don&rsquo;t get it, Riddle, do you? Possessing the wand isn&rsquo;t enough! Holding it, using it, doesn&rsquo;t make it really yours. Didn&rsquo;t you listen to Ollivander? <em>The wand chooses the wizard</em> &hellip; the Elder Wand recognised a new master before Dumbledore died, someone who never even laid a hand on it. The new master removed the wand from Dumbledore against his will, never realising exactly what he had done, or that the world&rsquo;s most dangerous wand had given him its allegiance &hellip;&rdquo;</p> <p>Voldemort&rsquo;s chest rose and fell rapidly, and Harry could feel the curse coming, feel it building inside the wand pointed at his face.</p> <p>&ldquo;The true master of the Elder Wand was Draco Malfoy.&rdquo;</p> <p>Blank shock showed in Voldemort&rsquo;s face for a moment, but then it was gone.</p> <p>&ldquo;But what does it matter?&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;Even if you are right, Potter, it makes no difference to you and me. You no longer have the phoenix wand: we duel on skill alone &hellip; and after I have killed you, I can attend to Draco Malfoy &hellip;&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re too late,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve missed your chance. I got there first. I overpowered Draco weeks ago. I took this wand from him.&rdquo;</p> <p>Harry twitched the hawthorn wand, and he felt the eyes of everyone in the Hall upon it.</p> <p>&ldquo;So it all comes down to this, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; whispered Harry. &ldquo;Does the wand in your hand know its last master was Disarmed? Because if it does &hellip; I am the true master of the Elder Wand&rdquo; (<em>DH,</em> chapter 36).</p> </blockquote> <p>You don&rsquo;t even have to <em>touch</em> a wand to win it. And not only that, when you disarm someone <em>you get all the wands</em> <strong><em>they&rsquo;ve</em></strong> <em>won</em>. That&rsquo;s how Harry gets the Elder Wand by disarming Draco, even though it&rsquo;s tucked away in Dumbledore&rsquo;s tomb.</p> <p>But at least you do have to disarm the other person <em>by force</em>, like Ollivander says, right? WRONG AGAIN:</p> <blockquote> <p>And now Harry was hurrying along a dark corridor in stout little Gregorovitch&rsquo;s wake as he held a lantern aloft: Gregorovitch burst into the room at the end of the passage and his lantern illuminated what looked like a workshop; wood-shavings and gold gleamed in the swinging pool of light, and there on the window ledge sat perched, like a giant bird, a young man with golden hair. In the split second that the lantern&rsquo;s light illuminated him, Harry saw the delight upon his handsome face, then the intruder shot a Stunning Spell from his wand and jumped neatly backwards out of the window with a crow of laughter (<em>DH,</em> chapter 14).</p> </blockquote> <p>Grindelwald wins the Elder Wand by just sneaking into Gregorovitch&rsquo;s bedroom and nicking it.</p> <p>Now, we could get into fussy debates over <em>intention</em>, and <em>malice</em>, and try to lay down some criteria for when nabbing someone else&rsquo;s wand <em>really counts</em> as &ldquo;disarming&rdquo; them and so transfers the ownership.</p> <p>But that would be <em>boring</em>. Let&rsquo;s just assume that anyone who grabs someone else&rsquo;s wand or otherwise disarms them gains ownership of every wand that person owns.</p> <p>So, which wands belong to who?</p> <h2 id="toc_1">Swaps that happen before Harry starts at Hogwarts</h2> <p>We just saw how Grindelwald steals the Elder wand from Gregorovitch. Let&rsquo;s write that down:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Grindelwald</strong> has Gregorovitch&rsquo;s and his own wands.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Gregorovitch</strong> has nothing.</p></li> </ul> <h3 id="toc_2"><em>DH,</em> chapter 35</h3> <blockquote> <p>&ldquo;I think he knew it, I think he knew what frightened me. I delayed meeting him until, finally, it would have been too shameful to resist any longer. People were dying and he seemed unstoppable, and I had to do what I could.</p> <p>&ldquo;Well, you know what happened next. I won the duel. I won the wand.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>Dumbledore</strong> has Grindelwald&rsquo;s, Gregorovitch&rsquo;s and his own wands.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Grindelwald</strong> has nothing. He lost Dumbledore long ago.</p></li> </ul> <h3 id="toc_3"><em>OotP,</em> chapter 28</h3> <blockquote> <p>Snape reacted so fast it was as though he had been expecting an attack: dropping his bag, he plunged his hand inside his robes and his wand was halfway into the air when James shouted, &ldquo;<em>Expelliarmus!</em>&ldquo;</p> </blockquote> <p>Poor Snivellus can never catch a break.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>James</strong> has Snape&rsquo;s and his own wands.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Snape</strong> has nothing. No wand, no dignity (we all saw his undies, remember?), no Lily.</p></li> </ul> <h3 id="toc_4"><em>DH,</em> chapter 33</h3> <blockquote> <p>Then a blinding, jagged jet of white light flew through the air: Harry thought of lightning, but Snape had dropped to his knees and his wand had flown out of his hand.</p> <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t kill me!&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;That was not my intention.&rdquo;</p> <p>Any sound of Dumbledore Apparating had been drowned by the sound of the wind in the branches. He stood before Snape with his robes whipping around him, and his face was illuminated from below in the light cast by his wand.</p> </blockquote> <p>This doesn&rsquo;t sound like an <em>Expelliarmus</em>; Dumbledore&rsquo;s too weird for any normal spells. It&rsquo;s certainly some sort of disarming, but&mdash;woops&mdash;James already disarmed Snivellus. Snape doesn&rsquo;t own his wand anymore.</p> <p>Here&rsquo;s how things stand going into the first book:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>James</strong> has Snape&rsquo;s and his own wands.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Snape</strong> has nothing.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Dumbledore</strong> has Grindelwald&rsquo;s, Gregorovitch&rsquo;s and his own wands.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Grindelwald</strong> has nothing.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Gregorovitch</strong> has nothing.</p></li> </ul> <h2 id="toc_5"><em>Philosopher&rsquo;s Stone</em></h2> <h3 id="toc_6"><em>PS,</em> chapter 10</h3> <blockquote> <p>Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand&mdash;not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: &ldquo;<em>Wingardium Leviosa!</em>&ldquo;</p> <p>The club flew suddenly out of the troll&rsquo;s hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over&mdash;and dropped, with a sickening crack, on to its owner&rsquo;s head.</p> </blockquote> <p>Because why should we limit this to wands? How very close-minded. The wand chooses the wizard, but the club chooses the mindless death machine, too. (Ron is pretty mindless, so the club chose well here.)</p> <ul> <li><strong>Ron</strong> has the troll&rsquo;s club and his own wand.</li> </ul> <h2 id="toc_7"><em>Chamber of Secrets</em></h2> <h3 id="toc_8"><em>CoS,</em> chapter 11</h3> <blockquote> <p>Both of them swung their wands up and over their shoulders. Snape cried: &ldquo;<em>Expelliarmus!</em>&rdquo; There was a dazzling flash of scarlet light and Lockhart was blasted off his feet: he flew backwards off the stage, smashed into the wall and slid down it to sprawl on the floor.</p> </blockquote> <p>Good for Snivellus, he owns a wand again!</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Snape</strong> has Lockhart&rsquo;s wand.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Lockhart</strong> has nothing but his looks.</p></li> </ul> <h3 id="toc_9"><em>CoS</em> chapter 13</h3> <blockquote> <p>Percy said, &ldquo;As a school Prefect&mdash;&rdquo;, but Harry had lost his temper. He pulled out his wand and shouted, &ldquo;<em>Expelliarmus!</em>&rdquo; and just as Snape had disarmed Lockhart, so Malfoy found the diary shooting out of his hand into the air. Ron, grinning broadly, caught it.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>Harry</strong> has his own wand and Draco&rsquo;s books.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Draco</strong> is going to have to buy new books.</p></li> </ul> <h3 id="toc_10"><em>CoS,</em> chapter 16</h3> <blockquote> <p>Harry reached his wand just in time. Lockhart had barely raised his, when Harry bellowed, &ldquo;<em>Expelliarmus!</em>&rdquo; Lockhart was blasted backwards, falling over his trunk. His wand flew high into the air; Ron caught it, and flung it out of the open window.</p> </blockquote> <p>Dang, Lockhart already lost his wands. Ron is actually throwing <em>Snape&rsquo;s</em> wand out the window. <strong>No changes</strong> here.</p> <blockquote> <p>&ldquo;Get up,&rdquo; said Ron sharply, pointing his wand at Lockhart.</p> <p>Lockhart got to his feet&mdash;then he dived at Ron, knocking him to the ground.</p> <p>Harry jumped forward, but too late. Lockhart was straightening up, panting, Ron&rsquo;s wand in his hand and a gleaming smile back on his face.</p> </blockquote> <p>Why doesn&rsquo;t Harry just <em>Expelliarmus</em> him again here? Possibly because Harry is pathetic; but who knows, really.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Lockhart</strong> has Ron&rsquo;s wand.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ron</strong> has the troll&rsquo;s club.</p></li> </ul> <h3 id="toc_11"><em>CoS,</em> chapter 18</h3> <blockquote> <p>Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George and Ginny got a compartment to themselves. They made the most of the last few hours in which they were allowed to do magic before the holidays. They played Exploding Snap, set off the very last of Fred and George&rsquo;s Filibuster Fireworks, and practised disarming each other by magic. Harry was getting very good at it.</p> </blockquote> <p>Well, since we don&rsquo;t know <em>who</em> disarms <em>who</em> here (THANKS, J.K.), let&rsquo;s just suppose that, since &ldquo;Harry was getting very good at it&rdquo;, he disarmed everyone else. That makes sense, right?</p> <ul> <li><strong>Harry</strong> has Hermione&rsquo;s, Fred&rsquo;s, George&rsquo;s, Ginny&rsquo;s and his own wands, and Draco&rsquo;s books.</li> </ul> <p>Let&rsquo;s review the scores:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Harry</strong> has Hermione&rsquo;s, Fred&rsquo;s, George&rsquo;s, Ginny&rsquo;s and his own wands, and Draco&rsquo;s books.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Hermione</strong> has nothing.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Fred</strong> has nothing.</p></li> <li><p><strong>George</strong> has nothing.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ginny</strong> has nothing.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Lockhart</strong> has Ron&rsquo;s wand.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ron</strong> has the troll&rsquo;s club.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Harry</strong> has his own wand and Draco&rsquo;s books.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Draco</strong> has a library card.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Snape</strong> has Lockhart&rsquo;s wand.</p></li> <li><p><strong>James</strong> has Snape&rsquo;s and his own wands.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Dumbledore</strong> has Grindelwald&rsquo;s, Gregorovitch&rsquo;s and his own wands.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Grindelwald</strong> has nothing.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Gregorovitch</strong> has nothing.</p></li> </ul> <h2 id="toc_12"><em>Prisoner of Azkaban</em></h2> <h3 id="toc_13"><em>PoA,</em> chapter 1</h3> <blockquote> <p><em>I couldn&rsquo;t believe it when Dad won the</em> Daily Prophet <em>Draw.

Since it probably &ldquo;chose&rdquo; him at Ollivander&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t think it knows or cares that Lockhart disarmed him the previous year.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Ron</strong> has his new wand and the troll&rsquo;s club.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Lockhart</strong> has Ron&rsquo;s old wand.</p></li> </ul> <h3 id="toc_14"><em>PoA,</em> chapter 17</h3> <blockquote> <p>It was Sirius Black.</p> <p>&ldquo;<em>Expelliarmus!</em>&rdquo; he croaked, pointing Ron&rsquo;s wand at them.</p> <p>Harry&rsquo;s and Hermione&rsquo;s wands shot out of their hands, high in the air, and Black caught them.</p> </blockquote> <p>Looks like Sirius took Ron&rsquo;s wand by force, then did some badass double-disarmery.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Sirius</strong> has Ron&rsquo;s new wand along with Harry&rsquo;s, Hermione&rsquo;s, Fred&rsquo;s, George&rsquo;s, Ginny&rsquo;s and his own wands.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Harry</strong> still has Draco&rsquo;s books, I guess.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ron</strong> has the troll&rsquo;s club.</p></li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>But Black&rsquo;s free hand had found Harry&rsquo;s throat&mdash;</p> <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he hissed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve waited too long&mdash;&rdquo;</p> <p>The fingers tightened, Harry choked, his glasses askew.</p> <p>Then he saw Hermione&rsquo;s foot swing out of nowhere.

He wins whatever wands are Hermione&rsquo;s and Harry&rsquo;s, which are none.</p> <h3 id="toc_15"><em>PoA,</em> chapter 19</h3> <blockquote> <p>Harry made up his mind in a split second. Before Snape could take even one step towards him, he had raised his wand.</p> <p>&ldquo;<em>Expelliarmus!</em>&rdquo; he yelled&mdash;except that his wasn&rsquo;t the only voice that shouted. There was a blast that made the door rattle on its hinges; Snape was lifted off his feet and slammed into the wall, then slid down it to the floor, a trickle of blood oozing from under his hair. He had been knocked out</p> <p>Harry looked around. Both Ron and Hermione had tried to disarm Snape at exactly the same moment. Snape&rsquo;s wand soared in a high arc and landed on the bed next to Crookshanks.</p> </blockquote> <p>Shit. <em>Exactly</em> the same moment?</p> <p>The boring interpretation is that since no one person disarmed Snape, nobody wins his wands. But that&rsquo;s not our only option: look where the wand lands!</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Crookshanks</strong> has Lockhart&rsquo;s wand.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Snape</strong> has nothing.</p></li> </ul> <h3 id="toc_16"><em>PoA,</em> chapter 20</h3> <blockquote> <p>Pettigrew had dived for Lupin&rsquo;s dropped wand.

Ernie Macmillan was flourishing his wand unnecessarily, giving his partner time to get in under his guard; the Creevey brothers were enthusiastic but erratic and mainly responsible for all the books leaping off the shelves around them; Luna Lovegood was similarly patchy, occasionally sending Justin Finch-Fletchley&rsquo;s wand spinning out of his hand, at other times merely causing his hair to stand on end.</p> <p>&hellip;</p> <p>&ldquo;Well, my dad is very supportive of any anti-Ministry action!&rdquo; said Luna Lovegood proudly from just behind Harry; evidently she had been eavesdropping on his conversation while Justin Finch-Fletchley attempted to disentangle himself from the robes that had flown up over his head.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>Fred or George</strong> has Zacharias&rsquo; wand.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ginny</strong> has Michael&rsquo;s wand.</p></li> <li><p>The <strong>Creeveys</strong> have all the books.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Luna</strong> has Justin&rsquo;s and her wands and his hair and his clothes.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Zacharias</strong> has nothing.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Michael</strong> has nothing.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Justin</strong> has nothing.</p></li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>&ldquo;That was really, really good, Harry,&rdquo; said Hermione, when finally it was just her, Harry and Ron who were left.</p> <p>&ldquo;Yeah, it was!&rdquo; said Ron enthusiastically, as they slipped out of the door and watched it melt back into stone behind them. &ldquo;Did you see me disarm Hermione, Harry?&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> <p>Maybe Hermione&rsquo;s inexplicable attraction to Ron (the boy so solid he cannot apparate half an inch across a room and who nobody likes) is due to the fact that he&rsquo;s always got her wand.</p> <h3 id="toc_24"><em>OotP,</em> chapter 32</h3> <blockquote> <p>&ldquo;Take his wand,&rdquo; she barked at someone he could not see, and he felt a hand grope inside the chest pocket of his robes and remove the wand. &ldquo;Hers, too.&rdquo;</p> <p>Harry heard a scuffle over by the door and knew that Hermione had also just had her wand wrested from her.</p> <p>&ldquo;I want to know why you are in my office,&rdquo; said Umbridge, shaking the fist clutching his hair so that he staggered.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here it&rsquo;s Malfoy disarming Harry and Millicent Bulstrode taking Hermione&rsquo;s wand. (It&rsquo;s always Millicent who gets Hermione. I wonder if Hermione smells like Millicent&rsquo;s cat because of the Polyjuice episode and that makes Millicent inexplicably attracted to Hermione. Huh.)</p> <p>Anyway, Harry still doesn&rsquo;t own a wand. Too bad Draco didn&rsquo;t relieve Harry of his homework planner, too; then Draco would get his books back!</p> <p>Hermione doesn&rsquo;t have shit either. <strong>No changes!</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>There was a commotion outside and several large Slytherins entered, each gripping Ron, Ginny, Luna and&mdash;to Harry&rsquo;s bewilderment&mdash;Neville, who was trapped in a stranglehold by Crabbe and looked in imminent danger of suffocation.

The person who disarmed Millicent was whoever cast the Disarming Charm (<em>Expelliarmus</em>, obvs), so it likely wasn&rsquo;t Neville or Ginny. Given Luna&rsquo;s relative ineptitude with the spell, there&rsquo;s a fair chance it wasn&rsquo;t her.

They fell where they stood, all except Greyback, who had been forced into a kneeling position, his arms outstretched. Out of the corners of his eyes, Harry saw Bellatrix bearing down upon the werewolf, the sword of Gryffindor gripped tightly in her hand, her face waxen.</p> <p>&ldquo;Where did you get this sword?&rdquo; she whispered to Greyback as she pulled his wand out of his unresisting grip.</p> </blockquote> <p>It&rsquo;s really too bad that Greyback didn&rsquo;t disarm Harry et al., instead of Scabior and the other shitheart Snatchers. Too bad Bellatrix didn&rsquo;t disarm instead of stun them. Then she would have <em>everything</em>.

And Harry, with the unerring skill of the Seeker, caught the wand in his free hand as Voldemort fell backwards, arms splayed, the slit pupils of the scarlet eyes rolling upwards.</p> </blockquote> <p>Looks like Harry is the master of the Elder Wand, after all. But this whole thing still doesn&rsquo;t make any sense, and Harry really shouldn&rsquo;t have thrown away the Elder Wand afterward since he doesn&rsquo;t own his anymore.</p> <p>Oh well.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Harry</strong> has Goyle&rsquo;s, Dumbledore&rsquo;s, Grindelwald&rsquo;s and Draco&rsquo;s wands, and Neville&rsquo;s new wand.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Voldemort</strong> has nothing (and is dead).</p></li> </ul> <h2 id="toc_40">The final tally</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>Harry</strong> has Goyle&rsquo;s, Dumbledore&rsquo;s, Grindelwald&rsquo;s and Draco&rsquo;s wands, and Neville&rsquo;s new wand.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Voldemort</strong> has nothing.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Neville</strong> has nothing.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Goyle</strong> has his health.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Luna</strong> has her new wand.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Some Death Eater</strong> has Justin&rsquo;s and some Slytherin&rsquo;s and his own wands as well as Luna&rsquo;s old wands, and Justin&rsquo;s hair and clothing.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Dobby</strong> has Narcissa&rsquo;s wand and no master.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Narcissa</strong> has nothing.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Draco</strong> has nothing.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ron</strong> has Bellatrix&rsquo;s and Greyback&rsquo;s wands and the troll&rsquo;s club.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Bellatrix</strong> has nothing.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Greyback</strong> has nothing.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Scabior</strong> has Voldemort&rsquo;s wand.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Snatcher 1</strong> has Mundungus&rsquo; wand.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Snatcher 2</strong> has Ron&rsquo;s, Harry&rsquo;s, Hermione&rsquo;s, Sirius&rsquo; and his own wands.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Snatcher 3</strong> has Dean&rsquo;s and his own wands.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Hermione</strong> has nothing.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Dean</strong> has nothing.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Mundungus</strong> has his pipe.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Stan</strong> has nothing.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Dumbledore</strong> has nothing.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Dolohov</strong> has Crabbe&rsquo;s wand and some Death Eater&rsquo;s wand and his own.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ginny</strong> has Michael&rsquo;s wand and some Slytherin&rsquo;s wand.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Warrington</strong> has nothing.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Millicent</strong> has nothing.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Crabbe</strong> has nothing.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Slytherin A</strong> has nothing.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Slytherin B</strong> has nothing.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Fred or George</strong> has Zacharias&rsquo; wand.</p></li> <li><p>The <strong>Creeveys</strong> have all the books.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Barty Crouch Jr</strong> has Pettigrew&rsquo;s wand.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Mr Weasley</strong> has Uncle Vernon&rsquo;s ornaments.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Uncle Vernon</strong> has an epic mustache.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Crookshanks</strong> has Lockhart&rsquo;s wand.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Snape</strong> has nothing.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Sirius</strong> has nothing.</p></li> <li><p><strong>James</strong> has Snape&rsquo;s and his own wands.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Grindelwald</strong> has nothing.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Gregorovitch</strong> has nothing.</p></li> </ul> <footer><p> Posted in <span class="tags"> <a class="tag" href="/t/wands">wands</a> <a class="tag" href="/t/spells">spells</a></span></p> </footer> </section> </main> <footer class="page-footer" role="contentinfo"> <div class="left-foot"> <p>All content copyright the respective author(s).</p> <p>“<a href="http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=9864" title="Smithsonian American Art Museum">Landscape with Castles and Deer</a>” is by M.

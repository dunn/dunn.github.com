[Codeless Language
Modules](http://www.barebones.com/support/develop/clm.html) (CLMs) are
plugins for
[TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/TextWrangler/) and
[BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) that add syntax
highlighting, code folding, and other capabilities for languages not
natively supported by these programs.

[Fountain](http://fountain.io/) is a plain-text syntax for writing
screenplays. (The [Fountain syntax](http://fountain.io/syntax) is
similar to that of
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), a
general-purpose syntax.) Fountain files are designed to be very
readable, but they can be easily converted to other formats (like PDF
and FDX) using [Fountain-friendly
applications](http://fountain.io/apps).

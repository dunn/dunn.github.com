<p>Last week, <a href="http://thoughtcatalog.com"><em>Thought Catalog</em></a> published an essay—ostensibly about a woman’s relationship with her boyfriend—that was full of anti-trans sentiments. A number of excellent replies were written, some also published on Thought Catalog, and we all hoped something had been learned. But today Thought Catalog pushed out an article by Jim Goad that was transphobic, racist, sexist, and pretty much exactly what you’d expect from one of the worst people on the internet.</p>
<p>The kicker is that this is Goad’s <em>sixth</em> piece for <em>Thought Catalog</em>. This is a problem.</p>

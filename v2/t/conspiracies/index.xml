&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, J.K. Rowling finally admitted that Ron and
Hermione should not have ended up together.  While this led us to
ponder what
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/dunndunndunn/status/429878749941596161&#34;&gt;alternate endings&lt;/a&gt;
Rowling might have secretly preferred, it offered powerful support for
the once-maligned
&lt;a href=&#34;http://the-toast.net/2014/02/03/regret-pairing-ron-hermione-together-ron-time-traveling-dumbledore-jk-rowling-admits/&#34;&gt;Ronbledore Theory&lt;/a&gt;,
which maintains that Ron &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; Dumbledore, and at some point went back
in time to live the majority of his life as the eldest son of Percival
and Kendra Dumbledore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/time.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Figure illustrating the Ronbledore theory&#34; title=&#34;Figure illustrating the Ronbledore theory&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Figure 1, above: The blue line represents the &amp;ldquo;Ron&amp;rdquo; period of Ronbledore&amp;rsquo;s life, and the green represents the &amp;ldquo;Dumbledore&amp;rdquo; period.  The exact point at which Ronbledore went back in time (represented by the cyan line) is unknown, but this essay will help to narrow the possibilites.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth of the Ronbledore Theory has by now been pretty well
established, but I would like to shore up its foundations with some
new evidence, evidence that will help explain &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; Ronbledore went
back in time, as well as&amp;mdash;roughly&amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;She doesn&amp;rsquo;t get your humor like I do&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step of this essay may seem to be a &lt;em&gt;non sequitur&lt;/em&gt;, but its
relevance will soon become apparent.  The first step is to show that
&lt;strong&gt;Ron and Luna Lovegood&lt;/strong&gt; are soulmates.  This is easily accomplished.
Allow me to draw your attention to two passages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, from &lt;em&gt;Order of the Phoenix&lt;/em&gt;.  Ron is here declaring his
intention to exert his prefect powers over Gregory Goyle:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For heaven&amp;rdquo;s sake, Ron &amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll make Goyle do lines, it&amp;rsquo;ll kill him, he hates writing,&amp;rdquo; said
Ron happily. He lowered his voice to Goyle&amp;rdquo;s low grunt and, screwing
up his face in a look of pained concentration, mimed writing in
midair. &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I … must … not … look … like … a … baboon&amp;rdquo;s … backside.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone laughed, but nobody laughed harder than Luna Lovegood. She
let out a scream of mirth that caused Hedwig to wake up and flap her
wings indignantly and Crookshanks to leap up into the luggage rack,
hissing. Luna laughed so hard her magazine slipped out of her grasp,
slid down her legs and on to the floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That was &lt;em&gt;funny!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her prominent eyes swam with tears as she gasped for breath, staring
at Ron. Utterly nonplussed, he looked around at the others, who were
now laughing at the expression on Ron&amp;rsquo;s face and at the ludicrously
prolonged laughter of Luna Lovegood, who was rocking backwards and
forwards, clutching her sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Are you taking the mickey?&amp;rdquo; said Ron, frowning at her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Baboon&amp;rsquo;s … backside!&amp;rdquo; she choked, holding her ribs (&lt;em&gt;OotP,&lt;/em&gt; chapter
10).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luna is the only person who truly appreciates Ron&amp;rsquo;s humor.  This point
is repeated in &lt;em&gt;Half-Blood Prince&lt;/em&gt; (&amp;ldquo;He says very funny things
sometimes, doesn&amp;rdquo;t he?&amp;ldquo;), and we also learn that Ron find&amp;rsquo;s Luna&amp;rsquo;s wit
equally enchanting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I could hear the match commentary from here,&amp;rdquo; said Ron, his voice
now shaking with laughter. &amp;ldquo;I hope Luna always commentates from now
on … &lt;em&gt;Loser&amp;rsquo;s Lurgy&lt;/em&gt; … &amp;ldquo; (&lt;em&gt;HBP,&lt;/em&gt; chapter 19)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baboon&amp;rsquo;s backside.  Loser&amp;rsquo;s Lurgy.  Surely, true love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True love, however, was not to be.  Ron ended up with Hermione&amp;mdash;for a
time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;“It is too late, you understand me?”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did Ron end up with Hermione, when our souls cried out in protest
and even Rowling knew it was wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer, ultimately, is that &lt;em&gt;it had to be so&lt;/em&gt;.  The course of Time
is fixed, and Ron&amp;rsquo;s choice of Hermione over Luna was a matter of cruel
necessity.  The course of Time is fixed: it is forever true that
Ronbledore went back in time, and so nothing can occur that would
alter that fact.  &lt;strong&gt;And Ron would not have gone back in time,
had he married Luna.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had he married his soulmate, had the baboon&amp;rsquo;s backside been blessed to
suffer from Loser&amp;rsquo;s Lurgy for all of his days, then Ron would have
been happy.  He would have lived his life, content, no longer jealous
of Harry&amp;rsquo;s fame because the one person in the world who understands
him would be always by his side.  There would have been no dissatisfaction,
no reckless urges to break free of a dreary day-to-day and make a
dramatic break with the present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But happiness was not to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ron married Hermione, and suffered.  It was for &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; reason that he
eventually went back in time, to escape the marriage he knew was wrong
and to &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; something of himself, somewhere where he would not
always be compared to the Boy Who Lived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhere?  Some&lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_2&#34;&gt;How to keep soulmates apart&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question remains, however, that torments all gentle hearts: how is
it &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; that Ron ended up with Hermione, when true love was
staring him in the face?  What could have prevented such a man from
pursuing Luna Lovegood and winning her hand?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What, or who?&lt;/strong&gt;  Attend to this passage from &lt;em&gt;Half-Blood Prince&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh, it&amp;rsquo;s a Gurdyroot,&amp;rdquo; she said, stuffing the cat litter and the
toadstool back into her bag. &amp;ldquo;You can keep it if you like, I&amp;rsquo;ve got
a few of them. They&amp;rsquo;re really excellent for warding off Gulping
Plimpies.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And she walked away, leaving Ron chortling, still clutching the
Gurdyroot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You know, she&amp;rsquo;s grown on me, Luna,&amp;rdquo; he said, as they set off again
for the Great Hall. &amp;ldquo;I know she&amp;rdquo;s insane, but it&amp;rdquo;s in a good&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He stopped talking very suddenly. Lavender Brown was standing at the
foot of the marble staircase looking thunderous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hi,&amp;rdquo; said Ron nervously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;C&amp;rsquo;mon,&amp;rdquo; Harry muttered to Hermione, and they sped past, though not
before they had heard Lavender say, &amp;ldquo;Why didn&amp;rsquo;t you tell me you were
getting out today? And why was &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; with you?&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;HBP,&lt;/em&gt; chapter 20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you beginning to understand?  When Lavender says &amp;ldquo;why was &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt;
with you&amp;rdquo;, she is not referring to Hermione.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now look!  Look at this passage from &lt;em&gt;Deathly Hallows&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I like this song,&amp;rdquo; said Luna, swaying in time to the waltz-like
tune, and a few seconds later she stood up and glided on to the
dance floor, where she revolved on the spot, quite alone, eyes
closed and waving her arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;She&amp;rsquo;s great, isn&amp;rsquo;t she?&amp;rdquo; said Ron admiringly. &amp;ldquo;Always good value.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the smile vanished from his face at once: Viktor Krum had
dropped into Luna&amp;rsquo;s vacant seat. Hermione looked pleasurably
flustered, but this time Krum had not come to compliment her. With a
scowl on his face he said, &amp;ldquo;Who is that man in the yellow?&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;DH,&lt;/em&gt;
chapter 8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever Ron admires Luna, whenever his heart is on the verge of
telling him its truth, &lt;strong&gt;a time-traveling witch or wizard arrives to
distract him.&lt;/strong&gt;  The most heartbreaking part of this is that these
magical anti-Cupids are most likely sent by Ronbledore himself, during
his Dumbledore years.  He knows that he &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; marry Hermione in order
to fulfill his destiny, and so deliberately undermines his own
happiness for the sake of the wizarding world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join me now in a moment of silence for the &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; great sacrifices
Ronbledore makes: first, his life, and then his love.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>There&#8217;s no such thing as the Trace</title>
      <link>http://baruffio.com/v2/p/trace</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2014 12:00:00 PDT</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Much is made in &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; about &amp;ldquo;the Trace&amp;rdquo;, the charm on
underage witches and wizards that is used by the Ministry to detect
illegal spellwork.  The problem is that there is no such thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;What is &amp;ldquo;the Trace&amp;rdquo; supposed to be?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most extended explanation of the Trace is given by Mad-Eye Moody
in &lt;em&gt;Deathly Hallows:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Second problem: you&amp;rsquo;re under-age, which means you&amp;rsquo;ve still got the
Trace on you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Trace, the Trace!&amp;rdquo; said Mad-Eye impatiently.  &amp;ldquo;The charm that
detects magical activity around under-seventeens, the way the
Ministry finds out about under-age magic!  If you, or anyone around
you, casts a spell to get you out of here, Thicknesse is going to
know about it, and so will the Death Eaters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We can&amp;rsquo;t wait for the Trace to break, because the moment you turn
seventeen you&amp;rsquo;ll lose all the protection your mother gave you.  In
short: Pius Thicknesse thinks he&amp;rsquo;s got you cornered good and
proper.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harry could not help but agree with the unknown Thicknesse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So what are we going to do?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re going to use the only means of transport left to us, the only
ones the Trace can&amp;rsquo;t detect, because we don&amp;rsquo;t need to cast spells to
use them: brooms, Thestrals and Hagrid&amp;rsquo;s motorbike&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;DH,&lt;/em&gt; chapter
4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trace apparently allows the Ministry to know &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; about the
location of underage wizards, in order to determine if they are
breaking the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage
Sorcery.  The Ministry has separate, unspecified ways of knowing when
and where magic is performed in the United Kingdom; the Trace does
&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; specifically tell the Ministry when an underage witch or wizard
&lt;em&gt;performs&lt;/em&gt; magic.  The Trace, in conjunction with the aforementioned
unspecified magic detection mechanisms, allows the Ministry to know
when magic is performed in close proximity to an underage witch or
wizard (the canny reader will see from the above quote that there&amp;rsquo;s
already a problem; but we&amp;rsquo;ll come to that).  This is what leads to the
Ministry issuing Harry with a warning when Dobby explodes a cake in #4
Privet Drive:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Mr Potter,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have received intelligence that a Hover Charm was used at your
place of residence this evening at twelve minutes past nine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As you know, underage wizards are not permitted to perform spells
outside school, and further spellwork on your part may lead to
expulsion from said school (Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of
Underage Sorcery, 1875, Paragraph C).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We would also ask you to remember that any magical activity which
risks notice by members of the non-magical community (Muggles) is a
serious offence, under section 13 of the International Confederation
of Warlocks&amp;rsquo; Statute of Secrecy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enjoy your holidays!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yours sincerely,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mafalda Hopkirk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Improper Use of Magic Office&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ministry of Magic&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;CoS,&lt;/em&gt; chapter 2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, sadly, this is all a terrible vicious lie.  The Trace does not
exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;Why can&amp;rsquo;t it exist?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Half-Blood Prince&lt;/em&gt;, Dumbledore shows Harry the recorded memory
of Morfin&amp;rsquo;s meeting with Voldemort.  Dumbledore explains that it is
nearly certain that Voldemort Stunned Morfin, took his wand, and
murdered the Riddle family.  Harry points out a rather large problem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But how come the Ministry didn&amp;rsquo;t realise that Voldemort had done
all that to Morfin?&amp;rdquo; Harry asked angrily.  &amp;ldquo;He was under age at the
time, wasn&amp;rsquo;t he?  I thought they could detect under-age magic!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You are quite right&amp;mdash;they can detect magic, but not the
perpetrator: you will remember that you were blamed by the Ministry
for the Hover Charm that was, in fact, cast by&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dobby,&amp;rdquo; growled Harry; this injustice still rankled.  &amp;ldquo;So if you&amp;rsquo;re
under age and you do magic inside an adult witch or wizard&amp;rsquo;s house,
the Ministry won&amp;rsquo;t know?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;They will certainly be unable to tell who performed the magic,&amp;rdquo;
said Dumbledore, smiling slightly at the look of great indignation
on Harry&amp;rsquo;s face.  &amp;ldquo;They rely on witch and wizard parents to enforce
their offspring&amp;rsquo;s obedience while within their walls.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well, that&amp;rsquo;s rubbish,&amp;rdquo; snapped Harry. &amp;ldquo;Look what happened here,
look what happened to Morfin!&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;HBP,&lt;/em&gt; chapter 17)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, we basically already knew that because of the Dobby thing.  We
already know why Voldemort didn&amp;rsquo;t get in trouble for doing magic at
the Gaunt House.  But &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;there were no other witches or wizards at the
Riddle house when Voldemort killed them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  How did the Ministry fail
to notice &lt;a href=&#34;http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/The_Trace&#34; title=&#34;Harry Potter
Wikia entry for \&amp;quot;The Trace\&amp;quot;&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;three uses of Avada Kedavra by a sixteen-year old in a
Muggle home&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few theories have surfaced to explain this inconsistency:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Talk:The_Trace#As_to_the_inconsistency_regarding_Tom_Riddle...&#34; title=&#34;Talk page for \&amp;quot;The Trace\&amp;quot; on the Harry Potter Wikia&#34;&gt;Voldemort was not underage when he killed the Riddles.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cedric Diggory was 17 in his sixth year, allowing him to enter the
Triwizard Tournament.  Wikia user Thanksherman proposes that
Voldemort was similarly old for his cohort, allowing him to come of
age and act without the Trace in his sixth year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with this theory is twofold: Not only does Dumbledore
not contradict Harry above when Harry asks how Voldemort could
have done magic without it being detected by the Ministry,
Dumbledore explicitly claims that Voldemort was then Harry&amp;rsquo;s
age&amp;mdash;and Harry wouldn&amp;rsquo;t turn 17 for some time.  When discussing
Voldemort&amp;rsquo;s conversation with Horace Slughorn (which occurs after
the Riddle House incident), Dumbledore says to Harry:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I am sure you understood the significance of what we just
heard.  At the same age as you are now, give or take a few
months, Tom Riddle was doing all he could to find out how to
make himself immortal&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;HBP,&lt;/em&gt; chapter 23).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trace works in strange ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are only sketchy descriptions of the Trace in the books,
leaving open the possibility that the Trace works in unintuitive
ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we do know is that the Trace breaks when a witch or wizard
turns 17, and the Ministry doesn&amp;rsquo;t
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Muggles%27_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Magic/Underage_Sorcery#Analysis&#34; title=&#34;Wikibooks: Muggles&#39; Guide to Harry Potter---Underage Sorcery&#34;&gt;keep tabs on the locations of adult wizards&lt;/a&gt;;
otherwise in &lt;em&gt;Deathly Hallows&lt;/em&gt; they would have chased after any
adult witches and wizards found in odd locations; Harry, Ron, and
Hermione would have been caught in short order.  (How the hell they
know that Harry casts his Patronus in &lt;em&gt;Order of the Phoenix&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ldquo;in
the presence of a Muggle&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Dudley&amp;mdash;would be another troubling
question, if the Trace exists.  But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the Ministry can&amp;rsquo;t track the locations of underage witches and
wizards &lt;em&gt;either&lt;/em&gt;.  You&amp;rsquo;d be forgiven for thinking so, since as
much is implied in &lt;em&gt;DH&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We wondered,&amp;rdquo; said Hermione tentatively, &amp;ldquo;whether Harry could
still have the Trace on him?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Impossible,&amp;rdquo; said Lupin. Ron looked smug, and Harry felt hugely
relieved. &amp;ldquo;Apart from anything else, they&amp;rsquo;d know for sure Harry
was here if he still had the Trace on him, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t they? But I
can&amp;rsquo;t see how they could have tracked you to Tottenham Court
Road, that&amp;rsquo;s worrying, really worrying&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;DH,&lt;/em&gt; chapter 11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in the quote at the very beginning of this essay, Moody states
explicitly that the Ministry &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; track underage witches and
wizards.  If they could, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether Harry traveled
from Privet Drive by Portkey, Thestral, broom, or Apparition.  And
in &lt;em&gt;HBP&lt;/em&gt;, Scrimgeour asks Harry where he went with Dumbledore
before the latter&amp;rsquo;s death, something he would know if the Trace
allowed the Ministry to actually track underage witches and
wizards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all this in mind, &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; can the Ministry know whether a bit
of magic, performed near a Traced person, is plausibly underage
sorcery or not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ministry might keep a list of underage wizards &lt;em&gt;known to be
alone&lt;/em&gt; or otherwise without magical supervision.  Harry would fall
in this category, as well as Muggleborns and other special cases
(like Voldemort at the orphanage).  Warnings are only sent when
magic is performed in the vicinity of these people&amp;rsquo;s homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this this just doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem true: when the Advance Guard
removes Harry from Privet Drive, Tonks casts several spells,
apparently with no repercussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The
&lt;a href=&#34;http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/The_Trace#Limitations&#34; title=&#34;Harry Potter Wikia entry for \&amp;quot;The Trace\&amp;quot;, section on
\&amp;quot;Limitations\&amp;quot;&#34;&gt;usual reply here&lt;/a&gt; is that the Ministry is notified when adult
witches and wizards (Arthur Weasley in &lt;em&gt;Goblet of Fire&lt;/em&gt;,
Dumbledore in &lt;em&gt;HBP&lt;/em&gt;) are going to visit.  The Ministry then
supposedly ignores magic for the duration of the visit.  But the
Ministry does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; know that the Advance Guard removed Harry from
Privet Drive.  Allowing the &lt;em&gt;Order of the Phoenix&lt;/em&gt; to take Harry
to the home of &lt;em&gt;Sirius Black&lt;/em&gt; does not seem like something the
Fudge administration would do.  Moreover, during Harry&amp;rsquo;s
disciplinary hearing, it&amp;rsquo;s made explicit that the Ministry
believes him to be still residing at Privet Drive:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re late.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sorry,&amp;rdquo; said Harry nervously.  &amp;ldquo;I&amp;mdash;I didn&amp;rsquo;t know the time
had been changed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That is not the Wizengamot&amp;rsquo;s fault,&amp;rdquo; said the voice. &amp;ldquo;An
owl was sent to you this morning. Take your seat&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;OotP,&lt;/em&gt;
chapter 8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course there&amp;rsquo;s some wiggle-room here as well; Fudge and
Umbridge are trying to get Harry expelled, so it&amp;rsquo;s possible they
arranged to have the letter sent to the wrong address.  But if
they &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; figure out that Harry was living at #12 Grimmauld
Place, the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black, they would
surely suspect him of having contact with the last Black family
member (a fine excuse to detain him for questioning and
harassment).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No way is there such a thing as &amp;ldquo;the Trace&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_2&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s really going on?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Trace doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist, why does everyone think it does?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The characters in &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; aren&amp;rsquo;t, well, &lt;em&gt;optimally rational&lt;/em&gt;.  Dumbledore
&lt;em&gt;tells&lt;/em&gt; Harry that underage witches and wizards can do magic in the
home of an adult witch or wizard, and Harry &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; doesn&amp;rsquo;t do magic
at the Burrow until he turns 17 and gets all excited.  Dumbledore
nearly allows Katie Bell &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Ron to die because he can&amp;rsquo;t think of a plausible pretext to
confront Malfoy about his whole assassination plan in &lt;em&gt;Half-Blood
Prince&lt;/em&gt;.  Ron never realized he&amp;rsquo;s allowed to do magic at home and
peels sprouts by hand for 17 years.  Hermione&amp;rsquo;s pretty smart I guess,
but she doesn&amp;rsquo;t really show a strong understanding of the Trace
either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;rsquo;s not a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; stretch to assume that it&amp;rsquo;s a lie spread by the
(equally inept) Ministry to control the magical population.  The
Ministry isn&amp;rsquo;t competent enough to actually implement the Trace, but the rest
are willing to believe in it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But questions remain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did the Ministry learn about Dobby&amp;rsquo;s Hover Charm in &lt;em&gt;Chamber of
Secrets&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did the Ministry learn about Aunt Marge&amp;rsquo;s big mistake, in order
to send people to Privet Drive to deflate her?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did Ministry learn about Harry&amp;rsquo;s Patronus in &lt;em&gt;Order of the
Phoenix&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My best guess at an answer to all three is &amp;hellip; Mrs Figg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_3&#34;&gt;Whaaaaaa?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I don&amp;rsquo;t like these sorts of conspiracy theories either.  But
she&amp;rsquo;s always near Privet Drive, and the only not-obviously-canon claim
I&amp;rsquo;m making is that she works for the Ministry rather than for
Dumbledore. (You could even argue that there is textual support for
this claim.  The tents that Mr. Weasley borrows from his Ministry
colleague Perkins in &lt;em&gt;GoF&lt;/em&gt; are &amp;ldquo;furnished in exactly the same sort of
style as Mrs. Figg&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; apartment (chapter 7), and also smell of cats;
if Perkins modeled his tents after Figg&amp;rsquo;s apartment, then that
suggests she is in regular contact with at least one Ministry
employee.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arabella Figg&amp;mdash;or one of her cats&amp;mdash;saw the Hover Charm (whether or
not they saw Dobby), saw Marge explode, and saw the Patronus.  She did
&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; see the Weasleys travel to the Dursley&amp;rsquo;s by Floo Powder, or see
the Advance Guard arrive in &lt;em&gt;OotP&lt;/em&gt;, or Dumbledore in &lt;em&gt;HBP&lt;/em&gt;.  Maybe she
was asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the books state that she &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; see the Patronus, and so she could
have communicated with the Ministry immediately after (using her own
Patronus&amp;mdash;if she&amp;rsquo;s only pretending to be a Squib&amp;mdash;or using a mirror
like the one Sirius gives to Harry or a Protean-Charmed object like
the DA coins).  That situation was already suspicious, because she
claims that she knew about Mundungus running off right away, but
didn&amp;rsquo;t bother contacting Harry and telling him to stay inside.  So
either she was lying about that, or knew Mundungus left to buy
cauldrons but had Ministry orders not to warn Harry (the Dementors
&lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; sent by Umbridge).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose Mrs Figg was spying on Harry for the Ministry because he&amp;rsquo;s
important and the Ministry wants to keep tabs on him.  Other
high-profile witches and wizards presumably get the same treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_4&#34;&gt;An objection&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might cry: &amp;ldquo;But surely a simpler explanation is just as you
said&amp;mdash;the Ministry is inept!  It&amp;rsquo;s not that the Trace doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist,
but rather the Ministry is just really bad about following up on the
instances of magic it detects.  Depending on how the Trace works,
either they just didn&amp;rsquo;t notice Voldemort&amp;rsquo;s magic performed at the
Riddle House, or they failed to see that Tonks cast &lt;em&gt;Lumos&lt;/em&gt; and some
silly trunk-packing spell when the Advance Guard came to get Harry.
See, no need to drag poor Mrs Figg into your wild imagination!&amp;rdquo;  (This
objection is from &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/zayalhawa&#34; title=&#34;Twitter
profile&#34;&gt;Aziza&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; be a better explanation, but for one thing.  As I noted
above, when the Ministry takes Harry to task for his Patronus in
&lt;em&gt;OotP&lt;/em&gt;, they know something that only Mrs Figg (or another spy) could
know: that Harry performed magic in the presence of a Muggle: Dudley.
If the Ministry doesn&amp;rsquo;t track the relatively small adult magical
population, the idea that they might be tracking all Muggles is pretty
wild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Couldn&amp;rsquo;t they be tracking just a &lt;em&gt;few&lt;/em&gt; Muggles of importance?&amp;rdquo;
Dudley&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; important, though; he already knows about magic, so
seeing &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; magic isn&amp;rsquo;t a major breach of the Statute of Secrecy.
The Ministry just &lt;em&gt;pretends&lt;/em&gt; it is while they&amp;rsquo;re trying to expel
Harry.&lt;/p&gt;

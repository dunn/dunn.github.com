<li><p><a href="thesis.html">“The Metaphysics of Ordinary Things”</a>, senior thesis, Reed College (2012)</p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em> Theories of metaphysical nihilism claim that there are no (or nearly no) objects with parts: no chairs, houses, mountains, and perhaps even no people. The philosophers who make these claims have trouble explaining why we nonetheless believe there are such things. The only successful explanation is compatible both with nihilism and with metaphysical universalism. Universalism claims that for every set of things, there is something else made up of those things; this thesis is intuitively more plausible than nihilism. But if we assume that universalism is true, and if we do not presuppose four-dimensionalism, we have to choose between two unintuitive versions of universalism: one that posits a plurality of co-located (entirely overlapping) objects, or one that denies that things can change their parts.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="tc.html">An essay on the problem with <em>Thought Catalog</em></a> (July 2013)</p>
<p>The website <em>Thought Catalog</em> recently published several essays that trafficked in transphobia, misogyny and racism, revealing some fundamental issues with their editorial philosophy. I summarized the history of the controversy, explained why <em>Thought Catalog</em> was wrong to publish those essays, and discussed what they will have to change so as not to repeat the mistake.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://sbshit.com"><em>Santa Barbara Bullshit</em></a> (June 2013–)</p>
<p>Two months after I started writing <a href="../dn/index.html"><em>The Daily Nonsense</em></a>, I decided to create <em>Santa Barbara Bullshit</em> in order to expand my scope to greater Santa Barbara. With <em>SBBS</em> I make light of the ignorant, reactionary, and simply bizarre opinions sometimes published by the local media. (It’s all available in an <a href="http://sbshit.com/archive.html" title="SBBS archive">archive</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="../dn/index.html"><em>The Daily Nonsense</em></a> (April 2013–)</p>
<p>In April I launched the satirical web publication <em>The Daily Nonsense</em> in order to needle UCSB’s <em>Daily Nexus</em> and their pitiful Opinion page. I have since published eleven short essays making good-natured fun of <em>Nexus</em> writers for their reactionary politics, sexism, homophobia, and general silliness; all are available in a convenient <a href="http://baruffio.com/dn/archive.html" title="Daily Nonsense archive">archive</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="lucidity.html">An essay on cultural appropriation at Lucidity Festival</a> (April 2013)</p>
<p>Santa Barbara-based Lucidity Festival has a problem with cultural appropriation. Unfortunately, the organizers don’t seem to have a firm grasp on what “cultural appropriation” means, and so they don’t see what the big deal is or why they should make changes to their festival. I wrote an essay outlining what cultural appropriation is, why it’s wrong, and how it’s happening at Lucidity.</p></li>

<li><p>Reed College Library (2010–2012)</p>
<p>I held two positions at the Reed College Library. Between the fall of 2010 and the spring of 2012—when I graduated—I worked at the circulation desk; since June of 2011 was one of the lead students supervising circulation operations. During the summer of 2011 I rewrote many of the circulation guidelines and formatted them for the web. In 2011 I was hired as a reference assistant. This position involved staffing the library’s reference desk and helping students, staff, faculty, and members of the public access library resources.</p>

<li><p>Oregon Humanities (2011)</p>
<p>During the summer of 2011 I worked as an volunteer intern in the Oregon Humanities office in Portland, OR. I worked on the Conversation Project, a new program designed to foster public debate on contemporary issues. In its third year scholars, writers, and other “conversation leaders” designed educational discussions that focused on community participation and dialogue. I assisted with public outreach, researching nonprofits statewide and asking them to host our conversation leaders. I also helped review the impact of the Oregon Humanities grant programs, and worked to make the Conversation Project’s web page more accessible.</p>

<li><p>Goleta Valley Beautiful (2010)</p>
<p>During the summer of 2010 I worked as a paid research intern with Goleta Valley Beautiful. GVB was contracted by the City of Goleta, CA to produce an Urban Forest Management Plan that would provide guidelines, standards, and ordinances to protect the trees within the city and promote the planting and maintenance of new trees in the urban forest. During my internship I familiarized myself with the literature on urban forestry and drew a number of previous drafts together into a single Management Plan. I met with City officials and incorporated their requirements into the document, quickly moving through several revisions. I also produced a cost-benefit framework for urban forests based on previous research by Ken Knight (Executive Director of GVB) and the USDA Forest Service.</p>

<p><strong>Trigger Warning:</strong> Discussion of misogyny, rape, and extreme physical and emotional violence against women.</p>
<h2 id="sucked-in-by-nsfwcorp">Sucked in by <em>nsfwcorp</em></h2>
<p>I only learned who Mark Ames is recently, when I started hearing about the magazine <a href="https://www.nsfwcorp.com/" title="*nsfwcorp* home page"><em>nsfwcorp</em></a> (<em>nsfwcorp</em> was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/14/vescere-bracis-meis/" title="Paul CarrÕs ÔThe New GambitÕ Wants To Be ÔThe Economist,Õ But Funny (And Tablet-Only!)">formed in 2011</a> and has apparently been running stories since <a href="https://www.nsfwcorp.com/dispatch/heart-attack/" title="This is Why They Hate Us: The Meat Monster">early 2012</a>, but only released their first print issue <a href="https://www.nsfwcorp.com/feature/relax-everything-will-be-fine/" title="The Kings of Garbage">last month</a>). Ames is the <a href="https://www.nsfwcorp.com/masthead/" title="*nsfwcorp* masthead">senior editor</a> and co-authored (with Max Blumenthal) a <a href="https://www.nsfwcorp.com/dispatch/breitbart/" title="Springtime for Breitbart">history</a> of Andrew Breitbart’s media “empire” that received a lot of praise. Even better than a gleeful attempt to tarnish Breitbart’s legacy (which has <a href="http://gawker.com/5890660/" title="Andrew Breitbart: Big Deal, Big Coronary, Big Corpse">already been done</a>) was Ames’ piece on the <a href="https://www.nsfwcorp.com/dispatch/unfit-to-report" title="Unfit to Report">right-wing propaganda</a> coming out of NPR. I myself happily shared that piece, as well <em>nsfwcorp</em>’s “Not Safe for War 100” list of media figures who supported the Iraq invasion and are likely to support further military action by the US. I planned on subscribing to the magazine.</p>
<p>But I didn’t <em>really</em> learn who Mark Ames is until yesterday.</p>
<h2 id="the-value-of-twitter-fights">The value of Twitter fights</h2>
<p>Ames is aggressive and rude, and often gets into heated spats on Twitter. He’s <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkAmesExiled/status/317421909467877376" title="Twitter">harassed Dave Weigel</a> for the latter’s youthful warmongering; Weigel for his part doesn’t take Ames too seriously:</p>

<p>Then something interesting happened, justifying my wasting so much time on Twitter:</p>

<p>This is a serious accusation; if true, those who associate with Ames have some decisions to make.</p>
<h2 id="digging-up-the-past">Digging up the past</h2>
<p>Jenny links to <a href="http://www.jimgoad.net/index.shtml?ames3" title="Mark Ames: the man-child who offered to fuck your kids">an essay</a> by Jim Goad, the <a href="http://takimag.com/about" title="About">editor of <em>Taki’s Magazine</em></a>. General Gandhi <a href="https://twitter.com/Bro_Pair/status/320049769085026305" title="Twitter">pointed out to me</a> that Jim Goad is not exactly a reliable source: <em>Taki’s</em> publishes <a href="http://gawker.com/5899884/racist-john-derbyshire-writes-most-racist-article-possible-pegged-to-trayvon-martin-case" title="Racist John Derbyshire Writes Most Racist Article Possible, Pegged to Trayvon Martin Case">racist garbage</a>, including a piece by Goad himself <a href="http://takimag.com/article/trayvonnosaurus_rex_jim_goad" title="Trayvonnosaurus Rex">in which he compares supporters of Trayvon Martin to the KKK</a>. Goad is also a raging misogynist who <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110606154606/http://www.nypress.com/article-6057-jim-goad-is-a-bad-man.html" title="Jim Goad is a Bad Man">regularly beat his wife and went to jail for assaulting another woman</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Goad has never expressed a scintilla of remorse. Asked if he’s sorry for beating Ryan, he tells me, “Absolutely not. I enjoyed it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So as not to leave any doubt about Goad’s moral character, here are the opening passages of his essay <a href="http://www.jimgoad.net/pdf/violence/lets.pdf" title="PDF">“Let’s Hear it for Violence Toward Women!”</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Women are only good for fucking and beating. When you get tired of fucking them, there’s only one thing left to do.</p>
<p>After you fuck them, they start talking. That’s when you beat them. They all talk too much, especially when you don’t want to hear it.</p>
<p>And what do they talk about? Violence toward women. But they fail to realize that their whining is what <em>provokes</em> most of the violence. They don’t understand what their eternal screeching does to men. Shut up! We don’t <em>need</em> to hit you. Just shut your mouths.</p>
<p>One simple rule, guys—the first time she gives you some lip, bust it open WIDE. She won’t talk shit again. Not if she’s smart, she won’t.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Chuck Palahniuk, the author of “Fight Club”, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120302220233/http://www.portlandtribune.com/features/story.php?story_id=12327" title="Citizen Goad">is a fan of Jim Goad</a>.)</p>
<p>Jim Goad is human garbage, so any accusations he makes against other people must be backed up by a lot of evidence.</p>
<p>In the case of <a href="http://www.jimgoad.net/index.shtml?ames3" title="Mark Ames: the man-child who offered to fuck your kids">his attack on Ames</a>, though, the evidence seems to be there. This is because all Goad really has to do is quote Ames himself.</p>
<p>In 2000, Ames and Matt Taibbi published <em>The eXile: sex, drugs, and libel in the new Russia</em>, described in a review by Martha Bayne as <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/beast-in-the-east/Content?oid=902762" title="Beast in the East">“breathtakingly misogynist”</a> (many of the following quotes were originally flagged by Bayne). Ostensibly a history of the founding of <em>The eXile</em> magazine, <em>The eXile</em> includes accounts of Ames’ and Taibbi’s sexual exploits, which—at least in the case of Ames—clearly involve rape and abuse. In one passage, Ames—then in his thirties—knowingly and in fact enthusiastically has sex with a 15-year-old-girl:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I went back into the TV room, Andy pulled me aside with a worried grin on his face.</p>
<p>“Dude do you realize…do you know how old that Natasha is?” he said.</p>
<p>“Sixteen?”</p>
<p>“No! No, she’s fif-teen. Fif-teen.” Right then my pervometer needle hit the red. I had to have her, even if she was homely (<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Er0eM6BsXggC&amp;lpg=PA153&amp;dq=mark%20ames%20pervometer&amp;pg=PA153#v=onepage&amp;q=mark%20ames%20pervometer&amp;f=false" title="Google Books"><em>eXiled</em>, 153</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ames then recounts how he threatened to kill a women he impregnated unless she consented to an abortion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I can’t do that,” she said. “I can’t kill our child.”</p>
<p>Right then, I stared at Katya with a look—I’m not sure how it appeared to her, but in my mind, I was started to contemplate two courses of action: murder, or AWOL.</p>
<p>“What will you do, kill me?” she said, laughing nervously.</p>
<p>“Maybe, yeah,” I replied. “I’ll throw you off my balcony. I’ll make it look like an accident.”</p>
<p>She started to cry, but I was relentless. I told her that if she had the child, she would be killing me, so it was an act of self-defense. And if I didn’t kill her, then I would flee Moscow and she’d never find me. Her child would be fatherless. He wouldn’t have an Oedipal complex like the other kids; his complexes would be monumental, guaranteed to make her life a living hell … I wore her down for hours during the night, KGB interrogation-style …</p>
<p>At 5:30 the next morning, Katya, acting the martyr, quietly slipped out of my apartment, made a beeline to the abortion clinic, and sucked the little fucker out (<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Er0eM6BsXggC&amp;lpg=PA153&amp;dq=mark%20ames%20pervometer&amp;pg=PA154#v=onepage&amp;q=awol%20kgb&amp;f=false" title="Google Books"><em>eXiled</em>, 154</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pushing women off balconies seems to be a recurring theme for Ames. According to Owen Matthews, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130227111747/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/the-gonzo-classic-that-wasnt-/261541.html" title="The Gonzo Classic that Wasn&#39;t?">Ames sometimes wrote under the name “Johnny Chen”</a>, and in one Chen column, <a href="http://exiledonline.com/old-exile/vault/bardak/chen/chen41.html" title="An Emerging Meet Market">the author rapes a young woman and then describes an imaginary conversation between himself and his dick (“Johnny Jr”)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Literally within four minutes of arriving, some teenager with a face like Muttley’s from Laff-A-Lympics fell off the bar and onto my shoulders. I carried her almost straight out to the coat check, then hurried her down to a taxi, ran her home, up my stairs, and into my apartment. The whole time she was begging me to take her back, to be careful, she was drunk, bla-bla-blah … After we were through, I had no idea what to do with her. She was bleeding and crying. As for me, I was depressed. I’d just shot a load large enough to repopulate North Korea. So I walked her over to my balcony, and held her in my arm, leaning her over the ledge.</p>
<p>“Throw her over,” Johnny Jr. advised me.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“You know you want to,” he said. “Just pick her up and throw her over. You’ll feel better, I promise.”</p>
<p>But I didn’t have the energy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given what we’ve seen, the claim that this is Ames is thoroughly unsurprising.</p>
<p>It’s of course possible that Ames is not Johnny Chen, but that that only removes one atrocity from the list. There are other examples of Ames’ horrific behavior referenced by Bayne in <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/beast-in-the-east/Content?oid=902762" title="Beast in the East">her review</a>, and I would not be surprised if what he’s been willing to publish does not exhaust his full history of violent and misogynist actions.</p>

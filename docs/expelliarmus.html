<h1 class="title">Wand ownership through the ages</h1>

</header>
<p>Until <em>Deathly Hallows</em>, we all thought <em>Expelliarmus</em> was just a nifty spell that causes people to drop their wands and sometimes knocks them off their feet (which is why we had all those Tower Truthers saying that <a href="http://www.beyondhogwarts.com/harry-potter/articles/dumbledore-clues.html" title="Beyond Hogwarts">Dumbledore wasn’t dead</a>). But then it turns out that it’s <em>totally bonkers</em>. Apparently disarming someone actually <em>transfers their wand’s loyalty to you</em>.</p>
<p>This is totally bonkers because <em>everybody disarms everybody</em> between Books 2 and 7. So to figure out whose wand is whose and what <em>really</em> happened, let’s catalog every instance of disarming ever.</p>
<p>Partytime.</p>
<h1 id="disarming-for-dummies">Disarming for Dummies</h1>
<p>For some reason J.K. has to have Harry P. “killing” He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named in the <em>very same way</em> that he beats You-Know-Who when he’s only a baby; namely, by having Lord Thingy’s <em>Avada Kedavra</em> bounce off the Chosen Boy like he’s some sort of magic mirror. In order to pull it off, Rowling drops this on us two-thirds of the way through <em>Deathly Hallows</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Hawthorn and unicorn hair. Ten inches precisely. Reasonably springy. This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.”</p>
<p>“Was?” repeated Harry. “Isn’t it still his?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps not. If you took it—”</p>
<p>“—I did—”</p>
<p>“—then it may be yours. Of course, the manner of taking matters.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“I took this wand from Draco Malfoy by force,” said Harry. “Can I use it safely?”</p>
<p>“I think so. Subtle laws govern wand ownership, but the conquered wand will usually bend its will to its new master” (<em>DH</em> 334–335).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you’re prone to fits of charitability, you might think that all this means is that, when you disarm someone else and take their wand, <em>eventually</em> the wand <em>might</em> “bend its will” to you.</p>
<p>But you would be wrong! Check out this bit during Harry’s rap battle with Voldy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You still don’t get it, Riddle, do you? Possessing the wand isn’t enough! Holding it, using it, doesn’t make it really yours. Didn’t you listen to Ollivander? <em>The wand chooses the wizard</em> … the Elder Wand recognised a new master before Dumbledore died, someone who never even laid a hand on it. The new master removed the wand from Dumbledore against his will, never realising exactly what he had done, or that the world’s most dangerous wand had given him its allegiance …”</p>
<p>Voldemort’s chest rose and fell rapidly, and Harry could feel the curse coming, feel it building inside the wand pointed at his face.</p>
<p>“The true master of the Elder Wand was Draco Malfoy.”</p>
<p>Blank shock showed in Voldemort’s face for a moment, but then it was gone.</p>
<p>“But what does it matter?” he said softly. “Even if you are right, Potter, it makes no difference to you and me. You no longer have the phoenix wand: we duel on skill alone … and after I have killed you, I can attend to Draco Malfoy …”</p>
<p>“But you’re too late,” said Harry. “You’ve missed your chance. I got there first. I overpowered Draco weeks ago. I took this wand from him.”</p>
<p>Harry twitched the hawthorn wand, and he felt the eyes of everyone in the Hall upon it.</p>
<p>“So it all comes down to this, doesn’t it?” whispered Harry. “Does the wand in your hand know its last master was Disarmed? Because if it does … I am the true master of the Elder Wand” (<em>DH</em> 497).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You don’t even have to <em>touch</em> a wand to win it. And not only that, when you disarm someone <em>you get all the wands they’ve won</em>. That’s how Harry gets the Elder Wand by disarming Draco while the Death Stick is tucked away in Dumbledore’s tomb.</p>
<p>Now that we know better than to be charitable, let’s assume this holds for everyone all the time. So, which wands belong to who?</p>
<h1 id="stuff-that-happens-before-harry-starts-at-hogwarts">Stuff that happens before Harry starts at Hogwarts</h1>
<p><em>OotP</em> 476:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Snape reacted so fast it was as though he had been expecting an attack: dropping his bag, he plunged his hand inside his robes and his wand was halfway into the air when James shouted, “<em>Expelliarmus!</em>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>BOOM</em>. The first wand changes hands.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>James</strong> has Snape’s and his own wands.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>DH</em> 454:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then a blinding, jagged jet of white light flew through the air: Harry thought of lightning, but Snape had dropped to his knees and his wand had flown out of his hand.</p>
<p>“Don’t kill me!”</p>
<p>“That was not my intention.”</p>
<p>Any sound of Dumbledore Apparating had been drowned by the sound of the wind in the branches. He stood before Snape with his robes whipping around him, and his face was illuminated from below in the light cast by his wand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This doesn’t sound like an <em>Expelliarmus</em>; Dumbledore’s too weird for any normal spells. It’s certainly some sort of disarming, but woops, James already disarmed Snivellus. Snape doesn’t own his wand anymore.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Dumbledore</strong> just has Grindelwald’s (duh) and his own wands.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>James</strong> has Snape’s and his own wands.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="chamber-of-secrets"><em>Chamber of Secrets</em></h1>
<p><em>CoS</em> 130:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Both of them swung their wands up and over their shoulders. Snape cried: “<em>Expelliarmus!</em>” There was a dazzling flash of scarlet light and Lockhart was blasted off his feet: he flew backwards off the stage, smashed into the wall and slid down it to sprawl on the floor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good for Snivellus, he owns a wand again!</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Snape</strong> has Lockhart’s wand.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dumbledore</strong> has Grindelwald’s and his own wands.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>James</strong> has Snape’s and his own wands.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>CoS</em> 162:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Percy said, “As a school Prefect—”, but Harry had lost his temper. He pulled out his wand and shouted, “<em>Expelliarmus!</em>” and just as Snape had disarmed Lockhart, so Malfoy found the diary shooting out of his hand into the air. Ron, grinning broadly, caught it.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Harry</strong> has his own wand and Draco’s books.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Snape</strong> has Lockhart’s wand.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dumbledore</strong> has Grindelwald’s and his own wands.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>James</strong> has Snape’s and his own wands.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>CoS</em> 200:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Harry reached his wand just in time. Lockhart had barely raised his, when Harry bellowed, “<em>Expelliarmus!</em>” Lockhart was blasted backwards, falling over his trunk. His wand flew high into the air; Ron caught it, and flung it out of the open window.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dang, Lockhart already lost his wands. Ron is actually throwing <em>Snape’s</em> wand out the window.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Harry</strong> has his own wand and Draco’s books.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Snape</strong> has Lockhart’s wand.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dumbledore</strong> has Grindelwald’s and his own wands.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>James</strong> has Snape’s and his own wands.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="prisoner-of-azkaban"><em>Prisoner of Azkaban</em></h1>
<p><em>PoA</em> 221:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was Sirius Black.</p>
<p>“<em>Expelliarmus!</em>” he croaked, pointing Ron’s wand at them.</p>
<p>Harry’s and Hermione’s wands shot out of their hands, high in the air, and Black caught them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looks like Sirius took Ron’s wand by force, then did some badass double-disarmery.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sirius</strong> has Harry’s, Ron’s, Hermione’s and his own wands.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Harry</strong> still has Draco’s books, I guess.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ron</strong> has nothing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hermione</strong> has nothing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>PoA</em> 222:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But Black’s free hand had found Harry’s throat—</p>
<p>“No,” he hissed. “I’ve waited too long—”</p>
<p>The fingers tightened, Harry choked, his glasses askew.</p>
<p>Then he saw Hermione’s foot swing out of nowhere. Black let go of Harry with a grunt of pain. Ron had thrown himself on Black’s wand hand and Harry heard a faint clatter—</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ron proves himself not entirely useless!</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Ron</strong> has Harry’s, Hermione’s, Sirius’ and his own wands.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sirius</strong> has nothing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>PoA</em> 224:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<em>Expelliarmus!</em>” Lupin shouted.</p>
<p>Harry’s wand flew once more out of his hand; so did the two Hermione was holding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hermione was holding her and Ron’s wands, but she didn’t take them by force from Ron; he still owns them (and Harry’s wand), and Lupin doesn’t disarm <em>him</em>, so I don’t think Lupin wins anything here. He wins whatever wands are Hermione’s and Harry’s, which are none.</p>
<p><em>PoA</em> 236:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Harry made up his mind in a split second. Before Snape could take even one step towards him, he had raised his wand.</p>
<p>“<em>Expelliarmus!</em>” he yelled—except that his wasn’t the only voice that shouted. There was a blast that made the door rattle on its hinges; Snape was lifted off his feet and slammed into the wall, then slid down it to the floor, a trickle of blood oozing from under his hair. He had been knocked out</p>
<p>Harry looked around. Both Ron and Hermione had tried to disarm Snape at exactly the same moment. Snape’s wand soared in a high arc and landed on the bed next to Crookshanks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shit. <em>Exactly</em> the same moment?</p>
<p>The boring interpretation is that since no one person disarmed Snape, nobody wins his wands. But that’s not our only option: look where the wand lands!</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Crookshanks</strong> has Lockhart’s wand.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Snape</strong> has nothing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>PoA</em> 249:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pettigrew had dived for Lupin’s dropped wand. Ron, unsteady on his bandaged leg, fell. There was a bang, a burst of light—and Ron lay motionless on the ground. Another bang—Crookshanks flew into the air and back to the earth in a heap.</p>
<p>“<em>Expelliarmus!</em>” Harry yelled, pointing his own wand at Pettigrew; Lupin’s wand flew high into the air and out of sight.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Harry</strong> has Pettigrew’s wands and Draco’s books.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pettigrew</strong> has nothing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Crookshanks</strong> has Lockhart’s wand.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Snape</strong> has nothing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ron</strong> has Harry’s, Hermione’s, Sirius’ and his own wands.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sirius</strong> has nothing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hermione</strong> has nothing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dumbledore</strong> has Grindelwald’s and his own wands.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>James</strong> has Snape’s and his own wands.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="goblet-of-fire"><em>Goblet of Fire</em></h1>
<p><em>GoF</em> 423–424:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But it was no use—the spider was either so large, or so magical, that the spells were doing no more than aggravating it—Harry had one horrifying glimpse of eight shining black eyes, and razor-sharp pincers, before it was upon him.</p>
<p>He was lifted into the air in its front legs; struggling madly, he tried to kick it; his leg connected with the pincers, and next moment he was in excruciating pain—he could hear Cedric yelling “<em>Stupefy!</em>” too, but his spell had no more effect than Harry’s—Harry raised his wand as the spider opened its pincers once more, and shouted,</p>
<p>“<em>Expelliarmus!</em>”</p>
<p>It worked—the Disarming spell made the spider drop him, but that meant that Harry fell twelve feet onto his already injured leg, which crumpled beneath him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After disarming the spider, Harry no longer feels alienated from his own body.</p>
<p><em>GoF</em> 444:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Voldemort was ready. As Harry shouted “<em>Expelliarmus!</em>”, Voldemort cried “<em>Avada Kedavra!</em>”</p>
<p>A jet of green light issued from Voldemort’s wand just as a jet of red light blasted from Harry’s—they met in mid-air—and suddenly Harry’s wand was vibrating as though an electric charge was surging through it; his hand had seized up around it; he couldn’t have released it if he’d wanted to—and a narrow beam of light was now connecting the two wands, neither red nor green, but bright, deep gold—and Harry, following the beam with his astonished gaze, saw that Voldemort’s long white fingers, too, were gripping a wand that was shaking and vibrating.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nobody gets disarmed here, we just get some <em>Priori Incantatem</em> nonsense. So there are no changes of wand ownership during this <em>geist ex whatthefuck</em>.</p>
<h1 id="order-of-the-phoenix"><em>Order of the Phoenix</em></h1>
<p><em>OotP</em> 293:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The room was suddenly full of shouts of <em>Expelliarmus</em>. Wands flew in all directions; missed spells hit books on shelves and sent them flying into the air.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p><em>OotP</em> 293:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Harry was too quick for Neville, whose wand went spinning out of his hand, hit the ceiling in a shower of sparks and landed with a clatter on top of a bookshelf, from which Harry retrieved it with a Summoning Charm.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Harry</strong> has Neville’s and Pettigrew’s wands and Draco’s books.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>OotP</em> 293:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<em>Expelliarmus!</em>” said Neville, and Harry, caught unawares, felt his wand fly out of his hand.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Neville</strong> has Pettigrew’s and his own wands.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Harry</strong> has Draco’s books.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>OotP</em> 293–294:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Something very odd was happening to Zacharias Smith. Every time he opened his mouth to disarm Anthony Goldstein, his own wand would fly out of his hand, yet Anthony did not seem to be making a sound. Harry did not have to look far to solve the mystery: Fred and George were several feet from Smith and taking it in turns to point their wands at his back.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Ginny was teamed with Michael Corner; she was doing very well, whereas Michael was either very bad or unwilling to jinx her. Ernie Macmillan was flourishing his wand unnecessarily, giving his partner time to get in under his guard; the Creevey brothers were enthusiastic but erratic and mainly responsible for all the books leaping off the shelves around them; Luna Lovegood was similarly patchy, occasionally sending Justin Finch-Fletchley’s wand spinning out of his hand, at other times merely causing his hair to stand on end.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Fred or George</strong> has Zacharias’ wand.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ginny</strong> has Michael’s and her own wands.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Creeveys</strong> have all the books.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Luna</strong> has Justin’s wand and his hair.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>OotP</em> 580:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Harry launched himself across the floor and grabbed the Death Eater around the knees, causing him to topple and his aim to go awry. Neville overturned a desk in his anxiety to help; and pointing his wand wildly at the struggling pair, he cried:</p>
<p>“<em>EXPELLIARMUS!</em>”</p>
<p>Both Harry’s and the Death Eater’s wands flew out of their hands and soared back towards the entrance to the Hall of Prophecy; both scrambled to their feet and charged after them, the Death Eater in front, Harry hot on his heels, and Neville bringing up the rear, plainly horrorstruck by what he had done.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Neville</strong> has Pettigrew’s and some Death Eater’s and his own wands.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fred or George</strong> has Zacharias’ wand.</p></li>

<li><p>The <strong>Creeveys</strong> have all the books.</p></li>

<blockquote>
<p>Harry hurried over to the door leading to the spiral staircase, but his hand had only just closed upon the iron ring of the door when he heard running footsteps on the other side. He looked round at Dumbledore, who gestured to him to retreat. Harry backed away, drawing his wand as he did so.</p>
<p>The door burst open and somebody erupted through it and shouted “<em>Expelliarmus!</em>”</p>
<p>Harry’s body became instantly rigid and immobile, and he felt himself fall back against the Tower wall, propped like an unsteady statue, unable to move or speak. He could not understand how it had happened—<em>Expelliarmus</em> was not a Freezing Charm—</p>
<p>Then, by the light of the Mark, he saw Dumbledore’s wand flying in an arc over the edge of the ramparts and understood … Dumbledore had wordlessly immobilised Harry, and the second he had taken to perform the spell had cost him the chance of defending himself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oooh, this is the important one.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Draco</strong> has Dumbledore’s, Grindelwald’s, and his own wands.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dumbledore</strong> has nothing.</p></li>

<p><em>DH</em> 49:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Harry sent Stunning Spell after Stunning Spell back at their pursuers, barely holding them off. He shot another blocking jinx at them: the closest Death Eater swerved to avoid it and his hood slipped, and by the red light of his next Stunning Spell, Harry saw the strangely blank face of Stanley Shunpike—Stan—</p>
<p>“<em>Expelliarmus!</em>” Harry yelled.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Harry</strong> has Stan’s wand.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The youngest-ever Minister of Magic</strong> has nothing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>DH</em> 152:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mundungus scrambled up and pulled out his wand; Hermione, however, was too quick for him.</p>
<p>“<em>Expelliarmus!</em>”</p>
<p>Mundungus’s wand soared into the air and Hermione caught it.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Hermione</strong> has Mundungus’ wand.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mundungus</strong> still has his pipe.</p></li>

<blockquote>
<p>“And we’ll have that,” whispered Ron, tugging Wormtail’s wand from his other hand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ollivander says this should work, but Neville owns Pettigrew’s wands, so Ron fails to expand his collection here.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ron</strong> has Harry’s, Hermione’s, Sirius’ and his own wands.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>DH</em> 321:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ron had burst into the drawing room; Bellatrix looked round, shocked; she turned her wand to face Ron instead—</p>
<p>“<em>Expelliarmus!</em>” he roared, pointing Wormtail’s wand at Bellatrix, and hers flew into the air and was caught by Harry, who had sprinted after Ron.</p>

<p><em>DH</em> 322:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The chandelier crashed to the floor in an explosion of crystal and chains, falling on top of Hermione and the goblin, who still clutched the sword of Gryffindor. Glittering shards of crystal flew in all directions: Draco doubled over, his hands covering his bloody face.</p>
<p>As Ron ran to pull Hermione out of the wreckage, Harry took his chance; he leapt over an armchair and wrested the three wands from Draco’s grip, pointed all of them at Greyback and yelled: “<em>Stupefy!</em>” The werewolf was lifted off his feet by the triple spell, flew up to the ceiling and then smashed to the ground.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, damn, it looks like this might work! Draco is holding his, Bellatrix’s, and Pettigrew’s wands.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Don’t kill him! DON’T KILL HIM!” Malfoy yelled at Crabbe and Goyle, who were both aiming at Harry: their split second’s hesitation was all Harry needed.</p>
<p>“<em>Expelliarmus!</em>”</p>
<p>Goyle’s wand flew out of his hand and disappeared into the bulwark of objects beside him; Goyle leapt foolishly on the spot, trying to retrieve it; Malfoy jumped out of range of Hermione’s second Stunning Spell and Ron, appearing suddenly at the end of the aisle, shot a full Body-Bind Curse at Crabbe, which narrowly missed.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Harry</strong> has Goyle’s, Dumbledore’s, Grindelwald’s, Draco’s and Stan’s wands.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Goyle</strong> has his health, which is more than we can say for Crabbe.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>DH</em> 442:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<em>Kill</em>.”</p>
<p>There was a terrible scream. Harry saw Snape’s face losing the little colour it had left, it whitened as his black eyes widened, as the snake’s fangs pierced his neck, as he failed to push the enchanted cage off himself, as his knees gave way, and he fell to the floor.</p>
<p>“I regret it,” said Voldemort coldly.</p>
<p>He turned away; there was no sadness in him, no remorse. It was time to leave this shack and take charge, with a wand that would now do his full bidding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hahahaha, Snape hasn’t owned a wand since the last time he was in the Shrieking Shack, way back in the third book.</p>
<p>This isn’t even a real disarming, anyway. It seems that only the ownership of the Wand of Destiny can be transferred through killing: “The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner” (<em>DH</em> 441). If Snape had any non-Elder wands, Voldemort probably wouldn’t have won them here.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Voldemort</strong> has his own wand.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Snape</strong> has nothing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>DH</em> 497:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A red-gold glow burst suddenly across the enchanted sky above them, as an edge of dazzling sun appeared over the sill of the nearest window. The light hit both of their faces at the same time, so that Voldemort’s was suddenly a flaming blur. Harry heard the high voice shriek as he, too, yelled his best hope to the heavens, pointing Draco’s wand:</p>
<p>“<em>Avada Kedavra!</em>”</p>
<p>“<em>Expelliarmus!</em>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looks like Harry is the master of the Elder Wand, after all. But this whole thing still doesn’t make any sense, and, just like that last time Harry and Voldemort dueled, no wands change hands.</p>
<p>Also Harry really shouldn’t have thrown away the Elder Wand afterward, since he doesn’t own his anymore.</p>
